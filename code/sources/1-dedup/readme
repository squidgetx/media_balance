# Organization Name Clustering

This directory contains code related to deduplicating/clustering similar organization names
The basic strategy is to use GPT to generate information about each organization.
Then, we use simple hierarchical clustering based on cosine similarity to group similar organizations together.

- python describe-orgs.py retrieves descriptions
- python cluster-descriptions.py clusters the descriptions together based on a distance threshold. We use 0.25 based on a set of test cases, erring on the conservative side (ie, we leave some similar descriptions unclustered and prioritize never making an erroneous grouping)
- Rscript check_clusters.R checks the clustering quality and then produces the final output.
