<p>Trumpâ€™s megaphone amplifies white nationalism</p>
<p>In the realm of political discourse, President Trump wields a megaphone that seemingly amplifies the disquieting strains of white nationalism. The recent sidelining of 'Judge Jeanine' on Fox News, followed by Trump's eagerness to reinstate her despite controversial remarks about Rep. Omar's hijab, underscores this amplification of Islamophobia.</p>
<p>Trump's penchant for tasteless political rhetoric reached a new low when he targeted the late John McCain on Twitter, prompting Sen. Chris Coons to call for an apology. The amplification of such divisive discourse raises questions about the state of our political landscape.</p>
<p>The college admissions scandal, dissected by federal prosecutors, has become a flashpoint amplifying concerns related to class and race. Those critical of affirmative action seize upon the scandal as evidence that elite colleges may lack impartiality in student selection, while defenders of racial preferences argue that economic privilege remains a more pervasive factor.</p>

<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, among others, points accusatory fingers at Trump for his role in amplifying racial and religious animosity. The divisive rhetoric, she contends, not only fails to unite but actively contributes to societal divisions.</p>
<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;>Regrettably, even respected news outlets find themselves amplifying Trump's rhetoric. Chris Wallace of Fox News, while attributing the Christchurch mosque shootings to the individual perpetrator, also acknowledged Trump's historical contributions to an atmosphere that fosters anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments.</p>
<p>Yet, Trump is not alone in amplifying messages that stoke hatred. An Australian anti-immigration lawmaker, criticized for linking Muslim immigration to the New Zealand shootings, found himself in a physical altercation with a teenager who protested by smashing an egg on his head.</p>
<p>Beto O'Rourke, in a moment of self-awareness, acknowledged his white privilege but proceeded to amplify it by positioning himself as a unique candidate from the U.S./Mexico border. The intricacies of such statements prompt scrutiny, with a subtle nod to other candidates like Julian Castro and Sen. Kamala Harris, who may offer distinct perspectives on immigration and national dialogue.</p>
