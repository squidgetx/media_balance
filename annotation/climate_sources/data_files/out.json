As a professional snowboarder, I\u2019ve ridden the steepest mountains in the world and spent weeks outside on foot-powered expeditions. Today I live in Truckee, a mountain town tucked into California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where I share my love of mountains with my wife and children. When we watch the Olympics, it still makes me joyous, but these days I also feel a little wistful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the world celebrates the achievements of athletes gliding over, down and across snow, I\u2019ve been reflecting on what I see in the mountains and for the future of these very Games. And for good reason. A team of researchers led by scientists at the University of Waterloo has found that if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not significantly reduced, only eight of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics will be cold enough to reliably do so again by the end of this century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Closer to home, the snowpack in the Sierra is at just 14 percent of the historical average. I never imagined I would see this in the middle of February.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The past three years were the hottest ever measured since record-keeping began in 1880, with 2016 ranking No. 1, followed by 2015 and 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists are warning us that the winter is becoming shorter . First freezes are starting later . So when I look at my children, I am even more convinced that we must take immediate and aggressive action on climate if we want their generation to learn these sports and enjoy winters in the mountains. More important, we must act quickly to preserve the culture and economies that depend on winter and snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report to be released this month by the group Protect Our Winters , which I founded, shows that tens of thousands of jobs are at stake in mountain towns as our climate warms. In total, the 191,000 jobs supported by snow sports in the 2015-16 winter season generated $6.9 billion in wages, while adding $11.3 billion in economic value to the national economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While a big snow season\u2019s economic boost is helpful, research shows that low snow years are disproportionately devastating, causing a combined annual revenue loss of $1 billion and 17,400 fewer jobs. These mountain towns are also the training grounds for American Olympians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All you have to do is watch the downhill race at Pyeongchang to know that snow-sports athletes don\u2019t just sit on their hands when faced with obstacles. That\u2019s why thousands of professional athletes, outdoor industry leaders, people who live in the mountains and those who live to ski and ride are joining forces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In person, through social media, in the streets and on Capitol Hill, we are letting our representatives know that believing in job creation and local economies means stepping up on legislation that supports renewable energy and places a price on carbon dioxide emissions. About 20 million people participate in winter sports every year. And many of them vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators in states with vital mountain economies love to talk about jobs. These people include Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Dean Heller of Nevada, both Republicans, along with representatives of congressional districts that include mountain towns, like Greg Walden of Oregon, Scott Tipton and Mike Coffman of Colorado, and my district\u2019s representative, Tom McClintock \u2014 Republicans as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the time comes to choose, these elected officials vote for legislation that will increase greenhouse gas emissions while ignoring the real threat to jobs in their own backyards \u2014 climate change. (Senator Gardner has a lifetime voting score from the League of Conservation Voters of 11 percent; Senator Heller\u2019s score is 13 percent. The top score among the representatives was 9 percent.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fossil fuel economy that they are voting to subsidize at substantial expense, both financial and environmental, won\u2019t last, and the sooner we move to renewable energy technologies, the better off we\u2019ll be. Our mountain economies still have a fighting chance, and we will fight for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/saving-winter-is-more-than-about-snow-its-about-jobs.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JEREMY JONES\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

As Arctic sea ice declines in response to warming temperatures, polar bears must fast for longer periods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prolonged fasting periods have been linked to reduced body condition, reproduction and survival in some polar bear populations, the study found. Continued sea ice loss ultimately threatens polar bear survival Arctic-wide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy \u2013 and inspiring action,\u201d said the University of Wyoming's Steven Amstrup, who conceived the project and is a co-author of the study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amstrup is also the chief scientist at Polar Bears International, a conservation organization dedicated to polar bears.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The authors modeled polar bear survival under a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario, which, if it occurs, would mean that all but a few polar bear populations would collapse by 2100, the study found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all,\u201d said Amstrup.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Recent Siberian heat wave 'almost impossible' without climate change, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read this: Arctic will see ice-free summers by 2050 as globe warms, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Climate change may push polar bears to the brink of extinction within 100 years, study says\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

It cost more than $300,000 -- thanks, Google's Sergey Brin -- and didn't taste very good. But the texture was right, and it saved a cow. Maybe one day it can save the Earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the real play behind the test-tube burgers. The hope, according to Dutch scientist Mark Post, who led the team, is that they can eventually help stop global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for moving away from raising and slaughtering animals for food is typically portrayed in terms of animal welfare. But increasingly the argument is about planetary welfare: Meat is simply a huge, huge contributor to climate change, and it's only going to get bigger as the billions of people in emerging economies begin demanding the meat-heavy diets they associate with wealth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this 2009 column, I laid out some of the numbers behind this debate. They're worth thinking about today. The column is slightly edited from its original version.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a 2006 United Nations report, livestock accounts for 18 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. That's larger than the entire transportation sector. Burgers, in other words, are doing more damage to the planet than SUVs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of meat's contribution to climate change is intuitive. It's more energy efficient to grow grain and feed it to people than it is to grow grain and turn it into feed that we give to calves until they become adults that we then slaughter to feed to people. Some of the contribution is gross. \"Manure lagoons,\" for instance, is the oddly evocative name for the acres of animal excrement that sit in the sun steaming nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. And some of it would make Bart Simpson chuckle. Cow gas -- interestingly, it's mainly burps, not flatulence -- is a real player.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the result isn't funny at all: Two researchers at the University of Chicago estimated that switching to a vegan diet would have a bigger impact than trading in your gas guzzler for a Prius (PDF). A study out of Carnegie Mellon University found that the average American would do less for the planet by switching to a totally local diet than by going vegetarian one day a week. That prompted Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to recommend that people give up meat one day a week to take pressure off the atmosphere. The response was quick and vicious. \"How convenient for him,\" was the inexplicable reply from a columnist at the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. \"He's a vegetarian.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The visceral reaction against anyone questioning our God-given right to bathe in bacon has been enough to scare many in the environmental movement away from this issue. The National Resources Defense Council has a long page of suggestions for how you, too, can \"fight global warming.\" As you'd expect, \"Drive Less\" is in bold letters. There's also an endorsement for \"high-mileage cars such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\" They advise that you weatherize your home, upgrade to more efficient appliances and even buy carbon offsets. The word \"meat\" is nowhere to be found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not an oversight. Telling people to give up burgers doesn't poll well. Ben Adler, an urban policy writer, explored that in a December 2008 article for the American Prospect. He called environmental groups and asked them for their policy on meat consumption. \"The Sierra Club isn't opposed to eating meat,\" was the clipped reply from a Sierra Club spokesman. \"So that's sort of the long and short of it.\" And without pressure to address the costs of meat, politicians predictably are whiffing on the issue. The Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, for instance, does nothing to address the emissions from livestock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pity of it is that compared with cars or appliances or heating your house, eating pasta on a night when you'd otherwise have made fajitas is easy. It doesn't require a long commute on the bus or the disposable income to trade up to a Prius. It doesn't mean you have to scrounge for change to buy a carbon offset. In fact, it saves money. It's healthful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it can be done immediately. A Montanan who drives 40 miles to work might not have the option to take public transportation. But he or she can probably pull off a veggie stew. A cash-strapped family might not be able buy a new dishwasher. But it might be able to replace meatballs with mac-and-cheese. That is the whole point behind the cheery PB&J Campaign, which reminds that \"you can fight global warming by having a PB&J for lunch.\" Given that PB&J is delicious, it's not the world's most onerous commitment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also worth saying that this is not a call for asceticism. It's not a value judgment on anyone's choices. Going vegetarian might not be as effective as going vegan, but it's better than eating meat, and eating meat less is better than eating meat more. It would be a whole lot better for the planet if everyone eliminated one meat meal a week than if a small core of die-hards developed perfectly virtuous diets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, if scientists could come up with an affordable, tasty meat that grows in a lab and doesn't impose much cost on the planet -- well, that might be the easiest solution of all.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

Their sturdy roots clung to the crumbling mountainside. Their gnarled limbs reached toward the desert sky. The rings of their trunks told the story of everything they'd witnessed \u2014 every attack they'd rebuffed, every crisis they'd endured. Weather patterns shifted; empires rose and fell; other species emerged, mated, migrated, died. But here, in one of the harshest environments on the planet, the bristlecone pines survived. It seemed they always would.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the day in 2018 when Constance Millar ascended the trail to Telescope Peak \u2014 the highest point in Death Valley National Park \u2014 and discovered hundreds of dead and dying bristlecones extending as far as she could see.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trees' needles glowed a flaming orange; their bark was a ghostly gray. Millar estimated that the damage encompassed 60 to 70 percent of the bristlecones on Telescope Peak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's like coming across a murder scene,\" said Millar, an emerita research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service who has studied bristlecone pines for the better part of 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a study published this spring, she and fellow researchers showed that the West's worst drought in at least 1,200 years had critically weakened the trees. Voracious bark beetles \u2014 a threat to which bristlecones were previously thought immune \u2014 delivered the death blow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After outlasting millennia of disruptions and disaster, human-caused climate change is proving too much for the ancient trees to bear. Rising temperatures have caused an explosion in the populations of insects that threaten the trees and undermined their capacity to defend themselves, scientists say. Although Great Basin bristlecone pines are not considered at risk of extinction, cherished specimens and distinctive populations are struggling to survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And bristlecones are not the only victims. At this very moment, a fast-moving fire is scorching through the iconic giant sequoia grove in Yosemite National Park. Cedars are choking on saltwater as rising seas engulf shorelines on the East Coast. A rare oak species clings to life as the Texas desert grows hotter and drier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that climate change has pushed almost a quarter of Earth's best-protected forests to a \"critical threshold\" for lost resilience \u2014 the point at which even a minor drought or heat wave could tip them into catastrophic decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Standing amid the devastation atop Telescope Peak, Millar realized, \"This could be a harbinger of what could be happening in the future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If nature's consummate survivors could not cope with catastrophic warming, she wondered, what did that mean for the rest of life on this planet?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And if humanity didn't heed the warnings of these fallen elders, what would it say about us?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Prehistoric jewels\u2019</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No organism on Earth is known to live as long as the Great Basin bristlecone pine. The oldest documented tree, a well-hidden specimen nicknamed \"Methuselah,\" after the long-lived biblical patriarch, was a sapling when the ancient Egyptians built their pyramids more than 4,500 years ago. Even the relatively youthful trees in Death Valley are older than gunpowder, paper money and the English language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Their presence and their stability and their fortitude stretches our own sense of time,\" Millar said. \"It just slows people down ... and reminds us of how things were before humans were here.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The secret to their survival is their ability to withstand what others cannot. They exist at higher elevations than almost any other tree, thriving in the rocky, meager soils near rugged mountain peaks. Their branching root systems and waxy needles help them make the most of scant water. They produce a thick resin that traps insect invaders and quickly patches wounds. Their genomes, which are nine times as long as a human's, contain a multitude of mutations that give them a better chance of adapting to changing conditions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Few trees can take a beating like a bristlecone. They deal with crisis by sectioning off parts of their structures, enabling the rest of the tree to keep living while the injured limb is allowed to die. Their wood is so dense it rarely rots; the trunks of dead trees will remain standing for millennia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The species needs all these strengths to exist in Death Valley \u2014 a forbidding environment even by bristlecone standards. The park is further south than any other bristlecone habitat, and hotter and drier than any other place in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scores of other creatures benefit from the trees' persistence, Millar said. Bristlecones provide shade to elk and bighorn sheep, and shelter chipmunks and jack rabbits from predators and fierce weather. They allow snow to cling longer to the mountains' upper slopes, ensuring a supply of meltwater during the brutal summer months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And their staying power makes them invaluable to scientists. Bristlecone tree rings have allowed researchers to reconstruct a record of Earth's climate going back thousands of years; the field of research is known as \"dendrochronology.\" The rings reveal when volcanic eruptions occurred, how long droughts lasted, even when the surface of the sun became blotted by magnetic storms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"By translating the story told by tree rings, we have pushed back the horizons of history,\" the pioneering dendrochronologist Andrew Ellicott Douglass wrote in National Geographic in 1929.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He compared tree ring records to the Rosetta stone and called the ancient trees of the desert Southwest \"prehistoric jewels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In preserving the planet's past, bristlecones also have given humans a key to understanding our future. They capture the interactions between greenhouse gases, rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns and altered ecosystems, and they allow scientists to project what will happen as Earth continues to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's well spelled out that the loss of these trees would remove this natural archive,\" Millar said. \"I hope the general public will realize what a loss that would be.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A death on our watch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After her grisly discovery atop Telescope Peak, Millar immediately contacted Barbara Bentz, a research entomologist for the Forest Service based at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Logan, Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just a few years earlier, Bentz had surveyed bristlecone populations across the West and found that few were succumbing to the bark beetle outbreaks that decimated so many other species. She felt confident that the trees would remain resilient even as rising temperatures caused beetle populations to explode.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, when Bentz peeled a piece of bark off one of the Death Valley bristlecones, she found scores of tiny tunnels created by beetle larvae as the insects chewed through the tree's living tissue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Oh, no,\" Bentz thought to herself. \"It really is beetles. Oh, no.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She and her colleagues uncovered further evidence of insect damage in Utah's Wah Wah Mountains, where young bristlecones were attacked by a small brown beetle called a pinyon ips.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the beetles were unable to complete their life cycles inside bristlecone pines, Bentz said. Instead, it seemed that they were reproducing in nearby trees from a species different from the bristlecone. Higher temperatures \u2014 Inyo County, home to Death Valley, is already more than 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than in the preindustrial era \u2014 allowed the beetles to reproduce faster and caused their populations to swell dramatically. When the surplus spilled over into bristlecones, their defenses were overwhelmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scientists think the trees had been so stressed by drought that they could not fend off attacks they once would have vanquished with ease. Climate analyses showed that 2020 soil moisture levels in Death Valley and the Wah Wah range dipped to their lowest levels in at least 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar said the discovery should raise alarms all over the West, where lakes are shrinking, snowpacks are declining and heat records are being set. The White Mountains \u2014 home to Methuselah and many more of the world's oldest bristlecones \u2014 lie just 100 miles from Death Valley and have a similar climate. They could easily become the next site of a beetle attack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't want Methuselah to die on our watch,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the species is not considered at risk of extinction, she added, the death of important subpopulations is still a reason to mourn. Each disappearance not only represents a loss for the landscape, but also is a sacrifice of the genetic diversity those populations contained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar recalled another visit to Death Valley, when she hiked through an area called the Last Chance Range in search of a bristlecone pine cluster that was rumored still to exist there. By the time she found a single remaining tree, it was dead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the specimen had a gene that made it uniquely capable of surviving in that forbidding landscape, there was no chance of resurrecting it. No hope of collecting seeds for replanting, or taking a cutting in an attempt to produce clones. No opportunity to draw on the tree's DNA to help the rest of the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That, to me, is the dramatic element of watching a population go extinct,\" Millar said. All of that unique genetic material, the product of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution, is gone for good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arid forests around the globe have experienced a devastating loss of resilience in the past two decades, according to the analysis published Wednesday in Nature. Satellite imagery shows that these ecosystems are less able to bounce back after fluctuations in weather or periods of drought. Tropical and temperate forests \u2014 the steamy Amazon, the North Woods of Minnesota \u2014 are in similar decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trend was seen in forests altered by human activities as well as those that remain almost untouched by direct human action \u2014 an indication that climate change, rather than local deforestation or pollution, is primarily at fault.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, 23 percent of untouched forests are approaching the point at which they could be pushed into an abrupt and irreversible transition, the scientists said. Rainforest could turn into grassland. Thick stands of pine might give way to shrubs and desert.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a strong warning, I think, for society,\" said Giovanni Forzieri, a professor of sustainable development and climate change at the University of Florence and lead author of the Nature study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He pointed out that most of the world's climate plans count on forests to pull planet-warming gases out of the atmosphere. If these ecosystems collapse, humanity will find it difficult, if not impossible, to stave off catastrophic warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Averting extinction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Murphy Westwood, the vice president for science and conservation at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois, each loss feels like a moral failing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's overwhelming and almost crushing,\" she said, \"the stark reality of the biodiversity crisis that's on our hands.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, Westwood helped publish a sweeping assessment of 58,497 tree species worldwide that found that nearly 30 percent are at risk of being wiped out. At least 142 species have gone extinct in the wild.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just trees. With global temperatures already more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than in the preindustrial era, the Earth is losing species at a rate hundreds to thousands of times faster than normal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the world remains on its current warming track, as much as 29 percent of all creatures on land will face very high risk of extinction. In the ocean, the destruction will be even greater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But humanity's growing understanding of all we might lose, Westwood said, also offers us a chance to change course. We can conserve rare organisms and protect fragile ecosystems. We can reverse deforestation and stop burning the fossil fuels that cause the planet to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we can see it happening in front of our very eyes,\" she said, \"then we know we have the tools and knowledge to prevent another extinction.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She pointed to an expedition she helped direct this spring, which rediscovered a tree that scientists had believed to be extinct.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures and dwindling water over the past century had killed off every known specimen of Quercus tardifolia, an oak known for its fuzzy evergreen leaves. But Westwood and other scientists held out hope that the species still clung to existence somewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After weeks of trekking through the canyons of Big Bend National Park in Texas, they stumbled upon a single tardifolia tree \u2014 scorched by fire and ravaged by fungal disease but undeniably, miraculously, alive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The researchers plan to collect acorns and cuttings from the tree that can be used to regrow the species in botanic gardens and arboretums.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a second chance to prevent a species extinction,\" said Wes Knapp, the chief botanist for the conservation nonprofit NatureServe and another member of the expedition. \"That's really rare, to have a second chance in nature. It means we can move. We can act. That's what we have to do now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further west, Millar and Bentz plan to return to Death Valley this August to more thoroughly assess the state of the park's bristlecone pines and then develop strategies for preserving the trees that remain. They are developing chemical repellents based on the trees' natural defenses to protect \"high-value trees,\" such as Methuselah. And they are surveying all the nation's bristlecone stands, searching for the genetic variations that might help the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the challenges facing both trees and humanity, Millar said, the bristlecones offer lessons in how to hang on. Their tenacity is an antidote to despair. Their genetic diversity is a bulwark as they face the unknown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"From a human standpoint, I think that translates into innovation and resilience,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To live like a bristlecone is to never let go of hope.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

This, like all his policies, is, he says, climate policy, and serves racial \"equity\" (by improving urban air quality).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the White House calls a \"fact sheet\" says Biden's administration will \"support market demand\" for EVs by \"driving demand\" with \"point-of-sale incentives\" to encourage \"deployment\" of EVs. Translation: Subsidies, including tax credits for purchasers, will fiddle the market by lowering EV prices enough to manufacture a demand sufficient to justify manufacturing the vehicles in quantities that the administration says are vital for the planet. Biden even wants $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations. When U.S. automobile sales exploded from 8 million vehicles on U.S. roads in 1920 to 23 million in 1930 without tax credits, the private sector, responding to real rather than synthetic demand, built sufficient gas stations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchasers, until a manufacturer sells 200,000. GM and Tesla have reached this cap. GM wants the tax credit restored and made permanent. Internal Revenue Service data for 2014 showed that the biggest beneficiaries were households with adjusted gross income of at least $100,000. One percent went to households earning less than $50,000. States, too, have joined the market manipulation. In California, where about 47 percent of EVs are sold, buyers can gain up to $15,000. That such subsidies \"work\" is shown by what happens when they end: In 2015, when Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit, EV sales plummeted 89 percent in two months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's policy to use less affluent Americans' money to entice more affluent Americans to buy EVs is only one of the contemplated regressive policies by which his administration would transfer wealth upward. Another such policy would cancel student debts for some of the fortunate minority of Americans who, having college degrees, will likely enjoy lifetime earnings significantly higher than those of the less fortunate majority. And if Democrats repeal the $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes by individuals filing their federal income taxes, this would almost entirely benefit very wealthy taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But desperate times require desperate measures, and Earth, the administration says, desperately needs EVs. For reasons unrelated to climate change \u2014 including cost and convenience \u2014 the future of EVs probably would be bright even without government midwifery. Perhaps, however, these should be called \"19.3 percent coal cars,\" that being the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal. Furthermore, Bjorn Lomborg, a climate writer, notes, EVs require large batteries that \"are often produced in China using coal power. According to the [International Energy Agency], just producing the battery for an electric car can emit almost a quarter as much of the greenhouse gases that a gasoline car will emit across its entire lifetime.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama-Biden administration \"Cash for Clunkers\" tried to meld economic stimulus and environmental stewardship. Consumers trading in old vehicles received vouchers for more climate-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 vouchers for $3,500 or $4,500, depending on the miles-per-gallon difference between trade-in and the new purchase. A Brookings Institution study found that the 55-day program's $2.85 billion essentially shifted \"roughly a few billion [consumers'] dollars forward from the subsequent two quarters following the program.\" Most of the 677,842 sales \u2014 that many clunkers were traded in and, as required by law, destroyed \u2014 were just \"slightly earlier [purchases] than otherwise would have occurred.\" They did create some jobs \u2014 at a cost of $1.4 million each.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, whose environmentally responsible recycling extends to recycling threadbare ideas, proposes $392 billion for 10 years of tax credits and vouchers for those who replace gas-powered vehicles with EVs. Biden wants to recycle the $7,500 EV tax credit. All such measures will have a climate impact too tiny to measure, given that U.S. personal cars, of which EVs will be a small proportion for many years, produce only 2.4 percent of global emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1928, presidential candidate Herbert Hoover's supporters said Republicans had put \"the proverbial 'chicken in every pot.' And a car in every backyard, to boot.\" Biden should promise coq au vin on every plate and two Teslas in every garage. Progress, or at least progressivism, is inexorable.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Several companies are experimenting with new shipping methods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, a 24,000-liter hermetically sealed plastic container, or flexitank, carrying organically grown pinot grigio from Sicily arrived in a cargo container at Filling Station East, a wine packaging facility near the port in Bayonne, N.J.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The wine was for Gotham Project, a company that specializes in kegged wine, which it sells to bars and restaurants in almost 40 states. The Sicilian pinot grigio, the equivalent of about 32,000 750-milliliter bottles, was siphoned through a thick hose from the flexitank into a 6,400-gallon stainless steel tank. Eventually, it will fill kegs, cans and bottles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But those bottles will not be the ordinary single-use wine variety that should be recycled (but more likely get trashed). These Gotham Project bottles are intended to be reused multiple times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of returnable, reusable bottles is to cut down on waste, while reducing the carbon output of the wine industry, moves dictated by the necessity of combating climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers have known for at least a decade that the single largest portion of the carbon footprint of a bottle of wine comes from the energy used to manufacture that bottle, transport it to the winery to be filled and then distribute it around the globe for consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the need to reduce humanity\u2019s carbon production becomes more urgent, some in the wine industry have begun to examine alternatives to the long-accepted, energy-guzzling methods for bottling and shipping wine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that some of the best solutions may be old methods of shipping and packaging, long ago discarded, like bottles that can be returned, sanitized and reused 10 times or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project is one of a few companies experimenting with selling wine in returnable bottles. Gotham\u2019s look like sturdy Burgundy bottles, green glass for reds and clear for whites and ros\u00e9s. But they are embossed with \u201cReturn & Reuse\u201d and sealed solely with corks, avoiding the waste that would come with foil capsules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham is trying out the bottles with a small group of retailers and restaurants in three state: New York, Massachusetts and Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reusable bottles are a natural next step for a company that for more than a decade has promoted the use of its stainless steel wine kegs as a better, less wasteful method of selling wines by the glass in restaurants and bars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFirst and foremost, we care about how the wine tastes: Freshness was top of mind,\u201d said Bruce Schneider, who, with a partner, Charles Bieler, founded Gotham in 2010. \u201cThe second factor was carbon footprint and reducing packaging waste.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Schneider estimates that by selling wine in reusable stainless steel kegs, which each hold the equivalent of 26 750-milliliter bottles, Gotham has eliminated more than 5 million single-use glass bottles from being tossed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOver 3 billion bottles a year go to landfill,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cOnly around 30 percent of glass bottles are recycled in the U.S. It\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And because the kegs use inert gas to fill the empty space as wine is poured out through a tap, the wine is kept fresher than it would be in bottles, which might sit around half empty for several days in a restaurant, slowly oxidizing, before they are emptied. From Mr. Schneider\u2019s perspective, reusable bottles are a natural evolution. It\u2019s after all not a new technology. Older generations may still remember the early morning arrival of the milkman, who would leave fresh bottles and take away the empties, which the dairy would reuse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thick soda and seltzer bottles were likewise returned and reused. Shoppers at farmers\u2019 markets today may still encounter similar reusable bottles from local dairies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reusable bottles have a long history in wine, particularly in European wine regions, where even today shoppers might carry their own demijohns to a nearby wine shop or cooperative, to be filled from a tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, frugality largely gave way to convenience in the last third of the 20th century. Disposability became a virtue to the detriment of the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham is not the only company to introduce reusable wine bottles. Good Goods, a New York start-up, began testing its reusable bottle with 14 retailers around the country last year. Zach Lawless, the chief executive of Good Goods, says wine producers who are environmentally conscious in their farming and production have a special incentive to adopt the bottles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey put so much effort into their work, but consumers don\u2019t experience it,\u201d Mr. Lawless said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to put their mission into how their product is experienced.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply switching to reusable bottles could diminish the amount of glass thrown away, but it cannot reduce the carbon footprint appreciably unless the shipping angle is addressed as well. That\u2019s where the flexitank comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As cargo gets heavier, it requires more fuel to ship. Aside from the energy required to manufacture wine bottles, the bottles themselves are relatively heavy. Environmentally conscious producers understand this and have tried to shave off weight, using lighter bottles. Nonetheless, plenty of producers continue to opt for wasteful trophy bottles, relying on a tried-and-true formula in which consumers equate heavier bottles with higher quality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A far better solution would be to ship wine in bulk, using flexitanks, essentially giant plastic bladders within metal frames, rather than bottles, and then to bottle the wine close to where it will be sold. This cuts way down on the weight of shipping. Mr. Schneider estimated that the wine in the 24,000-liter flexitank, which fit into one shipping container, would have required three containers if the wine had been bottled before shipping.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shipping in bulk is nothing novel. Every year wine is sold in bulk, often by producers making inexpensive wine that will be sold elsewhere in the world under any number of proprietary labels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes producers whose supply of wine is diminished because of vintage conditions will check the bulk market to see what supplemental wine might be available. During the last series of drought years, sharp-eyed consumers may have spotted inexpensive California wine brands with labels citing sources like Argentina or Languedoc in the fine print.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conversely, some Napa and Sonoma producers who were concerned that the California wildfires last year might have tainted certain vineyards sold off the wines made from those grapes on the bulk market rather than bottle it under their own label.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project does not buy wine on the bulk market. Rather, under long-term agreements it buys directly from producers who farm organically or sustainably in Europe, South America, California and New York.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I tasted Beaujolais, California sauvignon blanc, ros\u00e9 from the south of France, Tuscan sangiovese and Finger Lakes cabernet franc, all packaged in Gotham\u2019s returnable bottles. Each was fresh, clean and unpretentious, all delightful, inexpensive wines that were a pleasure to drink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as returnable bottles are nothing new, neither is shipping fine wines in bulk. Right up through the 1960s, renowned Bordeaux producers used to ship their wines in barrels to Britain, where they would be bottled for sale by merchants. If you are ever lucky enough to stumble upon, say, an old 1950s Ch\u00e2teau Latour from the cellar of some old London club, chances are the label will cite the merchant as well as the producer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The British, by the way, are today far ahead of Americans in point-of-sale bottling. Jancis Robinson, the British wine writer, estimates that as much as 45 percent of all still wine imported into Britain arrives in bulk and is bottled there, generally by supermarkets that sell a great deal of inexpensive wine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not all wines can be bottled at the point of origin. Many appellations, like certain Riojas or Brunello di Montalcino, require that wines be aged for a certain period of time in bottles before they can be sold. But plenty of wines face no such impediments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Creating a reusable bottle system is not nearly so simple as asking people to return the bottles they buy. Of necessity, returnable bottles must be thicker and heavier than those intended for single use, horrifyingly so if they were to be shipped any long distance rather than being bottled and sold locally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They need to be sturdy enough to withstand repeated cleanings, along with being shipped back and forth from filling facility to distributor to retailer to merchant. (That\u2019s the three-tier system in action, as required by law. It uses a lot of extra fuel.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reusable bottles must also have labels that are easy to remove when cleaning, hearkening back to the days before mobile phones, when rather than photograph the label of a memorable wine, you steamed the label off and pasted it in a scrapbook. For its reusable bottles, Gotham had to employ an older form of water-soluble glue rather than the more common pressure-sensitive adhesives, which are far more difficult to remove.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While reusable bottles are laudable and idealistic, they are worthless if consumers don\u2019t hold up their end by returning them. When Good Goods first tested its reusable bottle last summer, Mr. Lawless said, only 25 percent of them were actually returned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In analyzing the problem, Mr. Lawless said they learned asking for a small deposit, to be returned when the bottles were brought back, was not a sufficient incentive for consumers to overcome their preference for disposability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when Good Goods switched from a deposit system to offering store credit for returning the bottles, Mr. Lawless said, compliance rose to 85 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFraming it as a reward rather than a deposit made a massive impact,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project, on the other hand, has not asked for a deposit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Gotham is testing an app that will give consumers a choice of receiving a small cash reward for returning bottles or donating that amount to an environmental charity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe are hoping people will do it because it is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Scheider said. \u201cBut we also believe an incentive will help.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These reusable bottles are just tiny steps toward confronting a huge problem of waste and energy consumption. They are not the only possible solutions, either. One company in Britain is testing lightweight, flat bottles made of recycled plastic. Bacardi and other companies are testing biodegradable bottles made of plant materials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What\u2019s clear is the current system of shipping heavy, throwaway bottles around the globe is unsustainable, as simple and familiar as it might be. Change may seem difficult and inconvenient, but it\u2019s necessary and in the long run easier to accept than an overheated planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Podesta on Monday touted the administration record on energy production as well as climate change, arguing Democrats can run this fall on the fact they have bolstered the nation's oil and gas industry while tackling global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Podesta ran through a series of slides at the daily press briefing that showed the United States is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world, as well as the largest producer of gas and oil combined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In 2012 and 2013, it accounted for .22 and .24 percent of growth, which is the highest on record,\" he noted, adding, \"We've added 133,000 jobs in the last three years in the oil and natural gas extraction sector, and those numbers are projected to continue to grow.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Podesta -- who is overseeing the president's climate action plan -- noted that solar and wind production had increased during President Obama's tenure. Over this period, electricity generation from solar increased by more than 10 times, and tripled from wind power, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama will be showcasing the issue of climate change this week, by unveiling a report Tuesday detailing how global warming will affect the nation in the years to come and announcing new solar power commitments by the private sector at the end of the week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We obviously need all hands on deck if we're going to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, the impacts that the IPCC warned us about just a month or so ago and that the National Climate Assessment will bring into sharp focus with respect to the U.S.,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the briefing, Podesta said he was confident that Democrats could successfully counter criticism that they're opposed to domestic oil and gas production.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People will make that argument, but I think that if you look at the overall mix, it's cleaner, it's more domestically produced,\" he said. \"We have turned the corner so that we're now producing more oil than we're importing. Those are all facts that I think that -- that can be utilized by candidates to make the case that we're on the right path to have a cleaner, better and more secure, more American-made energy future for the country.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Podesta said he was confident the White House could beat back any attempts by congressional Republicans to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's upcoming proposal to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. which will come out in early June.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"All I would say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We're committed to moving forward with those rules,\" he said. \"We're committed to maintaining the authority and the president's authority to ensure that the Clean Air Act is fully implemented. That's critical to the health of the American people, the health of the economy and the health of our environment. So they may try, but I think that there's -- there are no takers at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

It will allow Biden to beef up environmental standards at home without the risk of American businesses losing out to companies that operate in countries with laxer environmental standards, they say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Biden administration wants to have a trading system where people are not advantaged by declining to follow through on commitments they've made to any number of issues, but notably on climate change in the 2015 Paris agreement,\" said Daniel Esty, a professor at Yale Law School with expertise in environment and trade policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift under Biden could spell a major change in the country's trade approach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue could come to a head sooner than later: More than 100 lawmakers sent a letter yesterday urging Biden to add Paris commitments to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Such an action would help restore the United States' role as a leader in addressing the climate crisis and demonstrate how trade agreements can be utilized to advance climate goals,\" the members write.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who leads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, points out that a simple majority in Congress can approve new multilateral environmental agreements under the deal. Blumenauer hopes the Biden administration takes advantage ofthat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After all, although the United States routinely signs trade agreements that include environmental provisions, critics say that those commitments lack teeth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the U.S. trade record is even more sparse when it comes to climate change issues specifically. Republicans in 2016 successfully pushed for a measure to limit the fast-tracking of any deals that require domestic carbon cuts. When the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal was signed two years later under President Trump, its language made no explicit mention of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And environmentalists were part of a coalition of interest groups that helped sink the Obama administration's proposed trade agreement with other Pacific Rim countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, over concerns it made it too easy for corporations to pollute abroad.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Biden campaigned on working with U.S. allies to use trade to combat climate change \"without offering too many specifics,\" said Alexandra Stark, a senior researcher at the New America think tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s choice for chief trade negotiator will have her work cut out for her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Katherine Tai, who Biden chose to be U.S. trade representative, has a history of pushing behind the scenes for strong environmental standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tai, who serves as the chief trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee, played a central role in negotiations around revising the North American Free Trade Agreement during the Trump administration.The resulting deal was criticized on the left for leaving out any mention of climate,but activists and politicians say that was despite her efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've seen her push ardently for environmental priorities to be taken seriously and, in fact, implemented in trade agreements,\" said Ben Beachy, director of the living economy program at the Sierra Club, an environmental group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe probably will force Biden to take a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The European Union is working to put in place a carbon border tax. Under this system, countries that have not already set a carbon price of their own may find that those prices are added in when they export their goods to Europe. It's a change that could have major repercussions for American industries, and it could spur discussions in the United States about how to avoid the fees \u2014 either by putting in place a domestic carbon price or coming up with an alternative treaty arrangement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The U.S. will have to respond,\" said Maria Panezi, a professor of international trade law at the University of New Brunswick in Canada. \"Given how quickly the European Union moves on this issue, their hand will be forced.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has moved away from pushing for a carbon price, instead focusing on economic stimulus and investments in green energy. At the same time, hisenergy plancalls for imposing \"adjustment fees or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Panezi suggests that this might be a difficult needle to thread: The World Trade Organization allows countries to impose adjustment fees on imports only if they already have their own domestic restrictions. \"You have to clean up your own backyard first,\" Panezi puts it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One option for the Biden administration would be to embrace legislation sponsored by Blumenauer that would impose a carbon tax in the United States and carbon tariffs for imported goods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's going be an argument that something like 50 other countries now have pricing mechanisms as part of their climate change strategies [and] American exporters will be at risk of facing carbon charges,\" said Esty, whowas floatedas a possible contender to lead the Environmental Protection Agency last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Biden administration is confronting a trade landscape radically altered by Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's trade wars have angered allies and supercharged tensions with China, and it may be hard to roll back the clock: Reducing tariffs couldspark pushbackfrom segments of U.S. industry or engender criticism that Biden is soft on China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the Trump administration so aggressively promoted the export of fossil fuels that the United Statesbriefly overtookSaudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign,Biden was unclear about whether he supportsbanning the export of fossil fuels.The United States blocked the sales of crude oil abroad for four decades until Congress and President Barack Obama lifted the moratorium in 2015.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tai also will have to balance human rights considerations:A recent reportfound that solar companies that supply more than a third of the world's polysilicon, a key ingredient in solar panels, are tied to forced labor in China's autonomous Xinjiang region.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental advocates want to make sure new trade agreements don't accelerate the race to the bottom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past, they've seen trade agreements as a problem rather than a solution because manycompanies have used free trade pacts to move operations to the countries with laxer pollution rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"These corporations then make steel, auto parts and other products with a high degree of climate pollution and send them back to the U.S. for our consumption,\" said Beachy of the Sierra Club. \"As a result, the amount of carbon that goes into the goods we import is so large that it equals the total carbon emissions of all U.S. factories combined.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As eager as allies may be for renegotiated deals with the new administration, they may have to wait.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has said that he intends to hold off on any new agreements until he has tackled top domestic priorities on the economy and coronavirus response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Biden is wasting no time fulfilling his campaign promise of nixing the Keystone XL pipeline, which is expected to be one of his first actions in office. Blocking the proposed oil conduit, meant to bring crude from Alberta to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, may end up being a point of contention between Biden and the leader to the north, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who supports the pipeline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Power playsBiden\u2019s Day 1 executive orders are set to overturn Trump\u2019s climate legacy on dozens of fronts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president-elect \"intends to sign more than a dozen executive orders and direct nearly 100 agency actions aimed at unraveling Donald Trump's environmental policies\" within hours of taking office Wednesday, our colleagues Steven Mufson, Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to a long-expected return to the Paris climate accord, Biden will sign \"a broad executive order\" to federal agencies to reassess scores of Trump-era environmental policies.

These are very real risks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yellen's commitments mark a victory for lawmakers and advocates who want the Biden administration to enlist Treasury's sweeping influence to address the dangers that climate change poses to the economy,\" Politico writes.

In some parts of the world, that is exactly what happened last year, climate scientists reported Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures add energy to the atmosphere, and computer models warn that this will produce wider and wilder swings in temperature and rainfall and alter prevailing wind patterns. In examining a dozen extreme weather events last year, scientists found that evidence that human activity \u2014 in particular, emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 was a partial culprit in about half of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet other extreme weather events, including the drought that withered the Midwest, appear to be just part of a natural pattern, the scientists concluded. The research, a series of 19 studies by 18 teams, was published in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While global warming will likely increase the number and severity of extreme weather events, climate scientists have been reluctant to attribute a particular heat wave, storm or drought directly to global warming, because of the natural variations of weather. But with advances in computer modeling and analysis of climate data, they are now able to tease out the contributions of human civilization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The extreme weather events \u201cwould have likely occurred regardless of climate change,\u201d said Thomas R. Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe importance of attribution research comes with understanding, however, the impact that climate change adds, or doesn\u2019t add, to any extreme event,\u201d he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The articles\u2019 editors likened climate change to someone habitually driving a bit over the speed limit. Even if the speeding itself is unlikely to directly cause an accident, it increases the likelihood that something else \u2014 a wet road or a distracting text message \u2014 will do so and that the accident, when it occurs, will be more calamitous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even when global warming contributes to extreme weather, \u201cnatural variability can still be the primary factor in any individual extreme event,\u201d the editors wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To examine causes of the Midwest drought last year, the most severe since the 1950s, researchers ran computer models comparing two situations: one with present-day concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the other with the much lower greenhouse gas concentrations before the Industrial Revolution. They found little difference in the frequency of Midwest droughts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But scientists performing a similar comparison for the heat wave that blanketed much of the United States in July last year estimated that such heat waves now occur four times as frequently because of the influence of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was really clear and it was really stark,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Peterson, principal scientist at the climate center. \u201cThings had changed dramatically.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another team, reviewing data on a heat wave in the eastern United States in the spring of last year, estimated that the activities of humans contributed about one-third of the 6.6-degree spike in temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis of Hurricane Sandy did not look at the dynamics of the storm, but rather how often floodwaters have reached the heights seen last October. Because sea levels have been rising, the chances of Sandy-like flooding inundating the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan have risen from once every 2,330 years in 1950 to once every 1,570 years today, the researchers said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If sea level rise over the next 40 years is low, about half a foot, then the chances of flooding increase slightly. If sea level rise is at the top end up of predictions \u2014 two yards \u2014 then much smaller storms would cause as much flooding as Sandy did and Lower Manhattan could be inundated every couple of years by 2100, the researchers said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cCoastal communities are facing a looming crisis due to climate-related sea level rise,\u201d said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and one of the authors of the Sandy study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Record-low ice cover in the Arctic in 2012 was partially caused by global warming, researchers also said. But heavy rains in northern Europe, China and Japan were all explainable by natural variability.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The island was declared effectively uninhabitable, water service was severed, and power is not expected back until month's end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate Point: Subscribe to USA TODAY's weekly newsletter on climate, energy and the environment</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With insurance and FEMA assistance, Melancon, 63, is already making plans to repair his oyster-sorting shed, to clean his yard of debris, and to replace the lawnmower swamped by Hurricane Ida's storm surge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while Melancon suffered relatively little damage this time, things could have been much worse, not just for him but for all of the approximately 1,500 people who call this island home, and for the tens of thousands more who vacation here each summer. Experts say Grand Isle is a harbinger for things to come: rising sea levels, stronger storms and more destruction for coastal areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With sea levels rising an average of 3.6 millimeters annually due to climate change, Louisiana's coast is simultaneously sinking, possibly in connection with the vast amounts of oil, natural gas and water that have been extracted over the past decades to fuel and power the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means places like Grand Isle, reached by a long causeway from mainland Louisiana, is demonstrating today what other coastal areas will see in the coming years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it raises questions about how long governments will try to protect property and how much tax money they're willing to spend rebuild roads and power lines and homes before ceding it to the sea. In 2014, federal scientists said Grand Isle sank 1.3 inches in five years, one of the largest drops globally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Louisiana coast is in general a canary in the coal mine,\" said Samuel Bentley, a Louisiana State University expert on coastal erosion. \"We are experiencing conditions now that other areas will face in the future. From the perspective of a homeowners or a city official, it doesn't matter if it's subsidence or sea level rise. It becomes a political decision at some point.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The history of 'hauntingly beautiful' Grand Isle, Louisiana</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Federal, state and local officials have long known the danger faced by Grand Isle, which under normal circumstances is a bucolic, sandy island with shave ice shops, fishing rodeos and beach bar after beach bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, the New York Times declared the island one of its top places to visit for 2020, ranking it with Greenland, Tokyo and the British Virgin Islands. But the reporter also asked, \"Does a place appear more hauntingly beautiful when you know it\u2019s disappearing?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First used by indigenous, nomadic natives, the Grand Isle and nearby Cheni\u00e8re Caminada and Leeville areas grew in the early 1800s as the French, Spanish and growing United States colonized Louisiana. Pirate and privateer Jean Lafitte frequented the area, and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War occupied an unfinished fort on adjacent Grand Terre Island, fleeing after the United States retook New Orleans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the enslavement of people was banned following the Civil War, plantations on Grand Isle were replaced by vacation resorts for the wealthy. They were themselves destroyed and then rebuilt following the 1893 Cheni\u00e8re Caminada hurricane, which sent a wall of water 16 feet high across the area, killing about half of the residents of the nearby farming community and erasing the fields that once grew produce for New Orleans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been trying to repair and protect the island since 1976, and in some areas installed a giant sand-filled tube known as \"the burrito\" running parallel to the ocean's waves at the highest point on the beach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'It ain't easy right now': Hurricane Ida strands residents, wipes away landmarks on Louisiana island</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those efforts have been repeatedly set back by hurricanes: 2005's Katrina damaged the repairs, which were almost fixed by the time Gustav arrived in 2008, destroying some of the repairs to the repairs. Subsequent hurricanes damaged subsequent repairs, and last summer, state taxpayers spent $7.5 million repairing levee breaches and building a new 1\u00bc-mile-long beach, which immediately became a popular gathering spot, drawing more people to the island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was a great summer, the island was booming. You could feel everyone doing good,\" said seventh-generation Grand Isle resident Holden Landry, 25.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Landry's family has owned one of the island's grocery stores, Sureway Supermarket since his grandfather founded it in 1976. His grandfather, Landry said, never saw storms like Ida.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My mom had two of these storms. And my sister and I had our first one at 25 and 27,\" Landry said. \"We all have a business plan down here, but God kinda scribbled over our plans.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ida knocked out power to the Landry's store, spoiling all the refrigerated and frozen food. As the island struggled without electricity 10 days later, Landry sat outside the store in a golf cart, escorting in what few customers came so they could buy essentials, from coffee to gas cans needed to keep generators running.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Landry, who left the island to attend college on the mainland, returned after graduation to help run the store, and now has a two-month-old son, the eighth generation to be raised here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cEach storm that hits, people go away. There\u2019s elderly locals who just don\u2019t come back,\" he said. \u201cThe easiest thing you could do is move away. But I want to stick it out. There\u2019s a lot of pride in being down here. If you have to start over, might as well start over in a place you have pride.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate could make hurricanes like 'freakish' Ida more common</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few doors down, Chris Collins took stock of his family's gas station and convenience store, Jo-Bob\u2019s. Like Sureway, the store wasn't officially open, but Collins and his mom were around to sell gas for generators, taking cash from people who had it, and giving IOUs to the others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019m grateful and humbled in ways I\u2019ve never been before,\" said Collins, who rode out the storm. \"That was a freakish storm. The worst case scenario? We just saw it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts predict storms like Ida will become more common as ocean waters warm, providing more heat energy to spin up hurricanes. Ida wasn't actually a worst-case scenario, they point out, because it intensified so rapidly that it never had time to generate a truly large surge like the 16-foot-high one from the 1893 Cheni\u00e8re Caminada hurricane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the howling winds ripped apart buildings, snapped power poles and drove stormwater nearly across the island. The three-foot-surge that hit the causeway serving Grand Isle peeled up portions of the road like flaking paint, narrowing the road to one lane in many areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Collins, 44, lived in New York City for many years, returning recently to help his parents run the store. He said he was shocked on his return to see how many more camps had been built in areas longtime locals would never have chosen, and the erosion of protective marshland caused by ships serving the offshore oil platforms blinking in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said he believes the loss of the island is ultimately inevitable \u2013 but struggles with how to adapt. Do they try selling to someone else? Wait for a government buyout? Just keep rebuilding their canopy and roof?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cRunning is not an option for me now,\" he said after a pause. \"The island still has its magic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back at his home, Melancon is picking through the debris, watching for roofing nails scattered in the grass, and wondering when the electricity and water will come back on. The seas have finally calmed, and he's anxious to get out to his oyster beds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His grandfather used to harvest oysters around Independence Island, but that has vanished beneath the waves, and Melancon now farms his oysters in several bays around Grand Isle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cGod took care of me,\" he said. \u201cI just want to get back to work.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The uncertain future of Grand Isle: 'Barrier islands are not forever'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conversations people on Grand Isle need to have are the same kinds of conversations coastal residents around the world need to be having, said Mark Davis, 67, the professor who directs the Tulane Center for Environmental Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Communities have to have a real conversation about the choices. Because otherwise at some point, decisions will be made for it,\" Davis said. \"The kind of issues that Grand Isle presents will replay in Miami Beach, in Norfolk, Virginia. We are going to face these questions and our options for each are different. But not one of them is ensured a future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WATCH: Louisiana slowly reopening after Hurricane Ida</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recovering from disaster: Hurricane Ida will be 'devastating' to tourism industry</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis said the physics of what's happening to Grand Isle are not up for debate, regardless of climate change \u2013 sandy barrier islands wash away while bearing the brunt of whatever storms hit them. Climate change, he said, is accelerating a geological process that's been well underway for centuries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Barrier islands are not forever. And sea levels are not forever. And right now they are shifting and changes at rates we have no experience with,\" he said. \"Grand Isle is in transition. The question is, transition to what?

Cycles of drought and deluge have always tested the limits of our water infrastructure's ability to keep agricultural and metropolitan areas habitable and productive (even as the sources of that water face ecological devastation), but climate change threatens more fires, more dry spells and higher temperatures.

Muller|Professor of Physics|University of California, Berkeley|Five scientific papers published on BerkeleyEarth.org|Academic|Muller discusses his change in perspective on global warming and the scientific methods used in his research.</p><p>N/A|N/A|Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project|N/A|Academic/Nonprofit|The project provides evidence and methodology related to earth's land temperature increase and its attribution to human activity.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Berkeley, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CALL me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I\u2019m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of the earth\u2019s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These findings are stronger than those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on global warming. In its 2007 report, the I.P.C.C. concluded only that most of the warming of the prior 50 years could be attributed to humans. It was possible, according to the I.P.C.C. consensus statement, that the warming before 1956 could be because of changes in solar activity, and that even a substantial part of the more recent warming could be natural.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our Berkeley Earth approach used sophisticated statistical methods developed largely by our lead scientist, Robert Rohde, which allowed us to determine earth land temperature much further back in time. We carefully studied issues raised by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations and poor ones) and from human intervention and data adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off). In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The historic temperature pattern we observed has abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect sunlight, make for beautiful sunsets and cool the earth\u2019s surface for a few years. There are small, rapid variations attributable to El Ni\u00f1o and other ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream; because of such oscillations, the \u201cflattening\u201d of the recent temperature rise that some people claim is not, in our view, statistically significant. What has caused the gradual but systematic rise of two and a half degrees? We tried fitting the shape to simple math functions (exponentials, polynomials), to solar activity and even to rising functions like world population. By far the best match was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as important, our record is long enough that we could search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent. Although the I.P.C.C. allowed for the possibility that variations in sunlight could have ended the \u201cLittle Ice Age,\u201d a period of cooling from the 14th century to about 1850, our data argues strongly that the temperature rise of the past 250 years cannot be attributed to solar changes. This conclusion is, in retrospect, not too surprising; we\u2019ve learned from satellite measurements that solar activity changes the brightness of the sun very little.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we\u2019ve tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect \u2014 extra warming from trapped heat radiation. These facts don\u2019t prove causality and they shouldn\u2019t end skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at least as well as carbon dioxide does. Adding methane, a second greenhouse gas, to our analysis doesn\u2019t change the results. Moreover, our analysis does not depend on large, complex global climate models, the huge computer programs that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s a scientist\u2019s duty to be properly skeptical. I still find that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I\u2019ve analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Katrina cannot be attributed to global warming. The number of hurricanes hitting the United States has been going down, not up; likewise for intense tornadoes. Polar bears aren\u2019t dying from receding ice, and the Himalayan glaciers aren\u2019t going to melt by 2035. And it\u2019s possible that we are currently no warmer than we were a thousand years ago, during the \u201cMedieval Warm Period\u201d or \u201cMedieval Optimum,\u201d an interval of warm conditions known from historical records and indirect evidence like tree rings. And the recent warm spell in the United States happens to be more than offset by cooling elsewhere in the world, so its link to \u201cglobal\u201d warming is weaker than tenuous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The careful analysis by our team is laid out in five scientific papers now online at BerkeleyEarth.org. That site also shows our chart of temperature from 1753 to the present, with its clear fingerprint of volcanoes and carbon dioxide, but containing no component that matches solar activity. Four of our papers have undergone extensive scrutiny by the scientific community, and the newest, a paper with the analysis of the human component, is now posted, along with the data and computer programs used. Such transparency is the heart of the scientific method; if you find our conclusions implausible, tell us of any errors of data or analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if the oceans are included. But if China continues its rapid economic growth (it has averaged 10 percent per year over the last 20 years) and its vast use of coal (it typically adds one new gigawatt per month), then that same warming could take place in less than 20 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in principle, is universally accepted.

If anything, the Earth is getting hotter faster than expected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Droughts, wildfires, floods</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, the world's tentative embrace of wind and solar renewable energy has bent the arc of a sizzling planet from apocalyptic by century's end (a 4 degrees Celsius increase over pre-industrial levels, or 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to merely catastrophic (3 degrees Celsius by 2100).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And promises on paper by nations to further cut emissions, if actually kept, could reduce temperature increases to maybe 2 to 2.4 Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even that would be terrifying. Disasters the planet already is experiencing in the form of droughts, wildfires, floods and intense storms would become more common and even more intense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One in 3 people would suffer severe heat rather than, as today, 1 in 7. Fresh water would grow more scarce, crop yields more meager and ocean ecosystems more distraught with the loss of coral reefs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the Paris accords urged every effort be taken to hold rising temperature from the pre-industrial era to 1.5 Celsius. It already has risen 1.1 degrees. Any hope of holding it to a 1.5-degree increase or even an unhealthy 2 degrees requires cutting fossil fuel emissions worldwide to net zero by 2050, and that means dramatic action this decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is an extraordinarily heavy lift given the fossil fuel dependency of such countries as China (30% of the world's emissions), the United States (15%), Europe (9%), India (7%) and Russia (5%) \u2013 and the barely addressed needs of less developed countries that must decarbonize and adapt to a warming climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists have made the math very easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a Reuters analysis of the findings, Earth can absorb only an additional 500 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions without warming beyond 1.5 Celsius. The nations of the world, led by China and America, now emit 50 billion tons per year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glasgow summit was important</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It feels insurmountable, and that's why the climate summit in Glasgow, hosted by the United Nations and the United Kingdom, was closely watched.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Joe Biden, to his credit, has reversed the reckless apathy of the Trump administration and pledged to cut U.S. emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, with dramatic plans to transform reliance on fossil fuels in generating power and fueling vehicles. He'll preach this in Scotland, but with the sad reality that Congress is struggling to approve his plans to reach those goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Promises by the other key polluters is a mixed bag as the conference begins:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe is pledging a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China, whose President Xi Jinping did not attend the climate summit, is talking about only beginning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>India shunned a net-zero promise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Russia is aiming to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and rely on its vast forests to do the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world's citizens have already have seen and felt too much of climate change to tolerate further platitudes or empty promises.

It says the agency will issue a formal notice of its intention to develop a new rule \u201csimilarly intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric utility generating units and to solicit information for the agency to consider in developing such a rule.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The document does not explain how the E.P.A. will justify to the courts the decision to eliminate the regulation. Several industry attorneys familiar with the agency\u2019s plans said they expected Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, to argue that the Obama administration relied on an overly broad reading of federal clean air laws in writing the Clean Power Plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump has vowed since the campaign to \u201cget rid\u201d of the Obama-era environmental regulations. He has called the Clean Power Plan \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cjob killing,\u201d and in an executive order issued in March he directed Mr. Pruitt to dismantle the rules. Last month, Mr. Trump appeared to claim he had already done so, telling a crowd in Alabama: \u201cDid you see what I did to that? Boom, gone.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Killing the regulation has also been a high priority for Mr. Pruitt, who as attorney general of Oklahoma sued to overturn it in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in recent weeks, industry groups have pressed the Trump administration to fashion a new, narrower measure in its stead. Many have argued that creating such a replacement, rather than simply repealing the Clean Power Plan, is necessary to avoid lawsuits. Under a landmark agency determination known as the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. is required to regulate carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Pruitt has been under pressure from interest groups that deny the scientific consensus on climate change \u2014 that it is occurring and caused by human emissions \u2014 to overturn that determination. The E.P.A. document does not indicate Mr. Pruitt\u2019s plans, but creating a new regulation implicitly accepts that the federal government has a role in addressing the reduction of carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It remains unclear when the agency will formally repeal the rule. Liz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the document or plans for the rule.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clean Power Plan, which required states to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent by 2030 relative to 2005 has been tied up in litigation. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had set an Oct. 7 deadline for the E.P.A. to show progress in its decision making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brian Deese, who served as a senior adviser on climate change to Mr. Obama, said the E.P.A. was buying time. Asking the public for ideas, he said, is what an agency does when it is uncertain about how to proceed. Consideration of a new regulation could take months or even years, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to walk this tightrope,\u201d Mr. Deese said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow @NYTClimate on Twitter</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/climate/trump-climate-change.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: LISA FRIEDMAN\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Last week, President Biden signed an executive order promising that by 2030, half of all new vehicles sold in the United States will be electric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a transformative change for a nation in no small way defined by its love of the internal combustion engine. But on the heels of the latest dire United Nations climate change report \u2014 which the U.N. Secretary General said \u201cmust sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet\u201d \u2014 does Biden\u2019s plan go far enough? And can the climate problem posed by America\u2019s car dependency really be solved by swapping gasoline for batteries? Here\u2019s what people are saying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Goodbye to gasoline</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gas-powered vehicles are the biggest single source of greenhouse gases in the United States, accounting for more than a quarter of the country\u2019s total emissions. \u201cA rapid shift from fossil-fueled combustion engines to electric vehicles is an essential step toward mitigating climate change,\u201d The Times\u2019s Coral Davenport says. \u201cYou can\u2019t solve climate change without getting rid of them.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In line with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, President Biden has promised to put the country on a path to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Because vehicles stay on the road for many years, though, it\u2019s estimated that all new cars would have to be electric by 2035 to reach that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s feasible, technologically, to replace most cars already on the road with equally affordable and powerful electric models within the next decade,\u201d Davenport says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where things stand: In the United States, E.V.s remain something of a rarity: Just 2 percent of new cars sold are electric or plug-in hybrid, a far lower rate than in China and Europe, in large part because those places have more generous financial incentives and stricter auto regulations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But underneath the surface, the market is unmistakably moving in the electric direction. This year, General Motors announced that it would phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Jaguar and Daimler, the world\u2019s largest maker of heavy trucks, soon followed. And in May, Ford introduced an electric version of its F-150 pickup truck, the best-selling vehicle in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transition could happen more quickly than some think. Justin Rowlatt, the BBC\u2019s chief environmental correspondent, believes the E.V. market right now is about where the internet was around the late 1990s or early 2000s. \u201cThe internet, like all successful new technologies, did not follow a linear path to world domination,\u201d he wrote in June. \u201cIts growth was explosive and disruptive, crushing existing businesses and changing the way we do almost everything.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are E.V.s really a silver bullet for America\u2019s car problem?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you were trying to create a sustainable society from scratch, blanketing the country with highways and hundreds of millions of individually powered vehicles that sit idle 95 percent of the time is not how you\u2019d do it. Cars \u2014 whatever their fuel source \u2014 are one of the least energy-efficient modes we have of getting from point A to point B. Some argue that climate change should spur the country to rethink the car\u2019s centrality in American life, rather than just to replace one version of it with another.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe planet will be much better off if we switch to electric cars,\u201d the Times columnist Farhad Manjoo writes. \u201cBut gauzy visions of the guilt-free highways of tomorrow could easily distract us from the larger and more entrenched problem with America\u2019s transportation system. That problem isn\u2019t just gas-fueled cars but car-fueled lives \u2014 a view of the world in which huge private automobiles are the default method of getting around.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Transitioning to E.V.s is seen by many as a more realistic path to net-zero emissions than breaking up America\u2019s love affair with cars, as Manjoo calls for. But just how realistic is it? Biden\u2019s executive order has no binding authority, and he has resisted calls to set a mandatory timeline for phasing out combustion engines, as the European Union has proposed and as California and Massachusetts have committed to doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the Biden administration plans to impose a set of emissions regulations it hopes will compel automakers to phase out gas-powered cars. But under the administration\u2019s current plan, those regulations \u2014 which officials say will be legally challenging to write \u2014 won\u2019t take effect until 2026. In the meantime, the administration plans only to restore emissions standards to about the levels that existed under President Barack Obama but were weakened during the Trump administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That timeline has drawn criticism from some analysts and activists. \u201cVoluntary pledges from auto companies make a New Year\u2019s resolution to lose weight look like a legally binding contract,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign. \u201cGlobal warming is burning forests, roasting the West and worsening storms. Now is not the time to propose weak standards and promise strong ones later.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the near term, the E.V. transition will depend on whether Americans are willing to make the switch. \u201cPossibly the biggest hurdle ahead is consumer acceptance,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto-data firm Edmunds, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWhat will it take for Americans to be willing to change their car ownership habits to go electric?\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One major obstacle to widespread adoption is anxiety over running out of power, as charging stations are still much sparser than gas ones. Another obstacle is expense: While E.V.s are cheaper for consumers in the long run, they can cost up to $10,000 more than their gas-powered counterparts upfront.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate passed this week would authorize only $7.5 billion to build charging stations across the country, half of Biden\u2019s original request, and it does not expand incentives for E.V. purchases. Automakers have said widespread adoption cannot happen without such investments. Democrats are aiming to incorporate more E.V.-related spending into their reconciliation bill, but its future remains uncertain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government could also spur adoption by raising the tax on gasoline, as the editorial boards of The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times have urged, but the Biden administration has called the idea \u201ca nonstarter.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without these big carrots and sticks, the E.V. transition could extend well beyond 2050. \u201cIf automakers phased out sales of new internal combustion engines, it\u2019s possible that older gasoline-powered cars might persist for even longer on the roads, as consumers who are unable to afford newer, pricier electric cars instead turn to cheaper used models and drive them more,\u201d The Times\u2019s Ivan Penn and Niraj Chokshi write.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that reason, some analysts argue that America\u2019s car fleet will have to shrink as it electrifies. \u201cIf electric vehicles are to play a major role in solving the climate crisis \u2014 which they must \u2014 they have to be paired with dramatic land use reform that shortens or eliminates a substantial portion of all vehicle trips, and replaces them with transit, walking, biking, shared vehicles, and other forms of mobility,\u201d writes Matthew Lewis, the director of communications at California YIMBY.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the car is still king</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it was difficult to imagine a sweeping overhaul of public transportation in the United States before the pandemic \u2014 in 2019, just 5 percent of American commuters used public transit to get to work \u2014 it\u2019s even more difficult now. The coronavirus pushed ridership and revenue off a cliff last year, and they still haven\u2019t recovered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decline was a global phenomenon, prompting a rapid investment in cycling infrastructure in some countries. But in the United States, the coronavirus has for the most part only strengthened the bond between Americans and their automobiles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf commuters shun public transit for cars as their cities recover from the pandemic, that has huge implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d The Times reported in March. \u201cMost importantly, if transit systems continue to lose passenger fare revenues, they will not be able to make the investments necessary to be efficient, safe and attractive to commuters.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate infrastructure bill allocates about three times the amount of money for highways as it does for public transit. To some, like The Urban Institute\u2019s Yonah Freemark, that\u2019s a big missed opportunity. \u201cThe bill does not seem likely to produce the conditions for a movement of Americans away from driving and toward other modes like transit, walking, and biking,\u201d he told The Verge. \u201cThe bill provides next to nothing for non-motorized modes of transportation.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E.V.s may not be the ideal climate solution, but they\u2019re the one Americans have to work with for now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do you have a point of view we missed?

It's a far cry from  rattling off the popular top 10 lists and stupid pet tricks that  were a large part of his more than three decades of wee-hours  television for CBS and NBC. But it's a chance for Letterman to give  voice to the issue of climate change on a new, albeit temporary,  home: National Geographic Channel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Letterman will join Jack Black, Ty Burrell, James Cameron, Thomas  Friedman, Joshua Jackson, Aasif Mandvi, Olivia Munn, Arnold  Schwarzenegger, Ian Somerhalder and Cecily Strong in the second  season of the documentary series \"Years of Living Dangerously,\"  which explores climate change and won a 2014 Emmy for outstanding  documentary or nonfiction series.

He touted the U.S. global response, which includes an investment of more than $15 billion, as a \"dose of hope\" and said he would announce additional commitments at a virtual COVID-19 summit Wednesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our security, our prosperity and our very freedoms are interconnected as never before. And so, I believe, we must work together as never before,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He reiterated that climate change is a \"code red for humanity,\" anticipating the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, next month. Biden announced he would work with Congress to double his commitment of $5.7 billion per year to help developing countries cope with the effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'Back at the table'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden, who's faced questions over U.S. credibility in the wake of the American military's withdrawal from Afghanistan, emphasized his administration's commitment to rebuilding alliances, including by reassuring NATO and European leaders and rejoining multilateral agreements that his predecessor, Donald Trump, left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and spur global action and shared challenges,\" Biden said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also used the diplomatic speech to underscored that the United States is \"not seeking a new Cold War,\" a message directly aimed at China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,\" he said in a message probably aimed at China, though he didn't explicitly mention Beijing. \"All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships, so they do not tip from responsible competition into conflict.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shadow of COVID-19 looms large over the annual summit, which took place virtually last year. But the event also comes as the Biden administration also struggles to contain the fallout from a series of diplomatic blunders, including a chaotic and deadly evacuation in Afghanistan after the Taliban swept to power last month. The Pentagon acknowledged Friday that 10 civilians, including an aid worker and as many as seven children, were killed in a drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, in the final days of the 20-year war.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>France recalled its ambassador to the United States and Australia after it was rattled by a new partnership between the two countries and the U.K. that rendered a French submarine contract obsolete. Foreign leaders have criticized Biden's campaign to give Americans a COVID-19 booster shot before prioritizing countries where people have yet to receive their first vaccine dose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Criticized from all sides, Biden scrambles to address surge of Haitian migrants at southern border</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our allies and adversaries have to make one judgment: Are these missteps a headline that will pass, or are they a trend line?\" said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department adviser.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president headed off some criticism Monday when the administration lifted a travel ban on vaccinated foreign nationals after European officials expressed frustration over his refusal to lift the restrictions, which were implemented under President Donald Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden, a long-standing internationalist, will have convince allies the United States is committed to returning to its role at the head of the diplomatic table on crises such as COVID-19 and climate change, even as he remains focused on domestic priorities, including passing landmark legislation on infrastructure and expanding social programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think our allies \u2013 particularly Europeans \u2013 are increasingly persuaded of two things: that Joe Biden's bandwidth and ability to focus on foreign policy is narrower than they thought, and I think they are extremely concerned that we're going to toggle back to another political change in 2022 or 2024,\" Miller said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president kicked off a week crammed with diplomatic activities Monday night by meeting U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York before the summit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president met Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and later welcomed U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the White House. He will meet Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden will hold a virtual COVID-19 summit Wednesday and host the first in-person meeting with leaders of the \"Quad\" partnership in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 the United States, Japan, India and Australia \u2013 at the White House Friday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alynna Lyon, an expert on the United Nations at the University of New Hampshire, said expectations are high as Biden can't rely on some of the traditional relationships with allies who could create momentum for his global agenda and rally international partners around U.S. leadership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There is some real credibility issues there about working together because the administration has demonstrated a few times just in the last month or so that there are several places in which it will go alone and make decisions without collaboration,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's history with the UN</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's relationship with the United Nations dates back to the 1990s when a Republican-led Congress withheld contributions to the global body.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden worked with his Republican counterpart and the committee's chairman, North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to hammer out an agreement for the United States to pay its dues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As vice president, Biden frequently met with foreign leaders at the annual summit and engaged in what Lyon described as \"cocktail napkin diplomacy\" on the sidelines of the General Assembly. He sat in for President Barack Obama in a number of sessions, including one on combating the Islamic State terrorist group in 2015, and co-chaired a U.N. peacekeeping summit in 2014.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Biden himself is prone to cooperation and collaboration and values that work historically,\" Lyon said. \"So a lot of us are puzzled that the Biden administration seems to contradict their own narrative, their own story about cooperation as being important and essential and yet not working multilaterally.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president took office with years of foreign policy experience and global standing that provided a familiar balm to those alarmed by the four years of Trump's \"America first\" isolationist foreign policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the early months, Biden tried to reassure allies by reversing some of his predecessor's policies, including recommitting to the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and launching negotiations about rejoining the nuclear deal with Iran. In his first foreign trip abroad, Biden sought to rebuild international relations at the G-7 summit in Cornwall, followed by a meeting with NATO leaders at the headquarters in Brussels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Trump is gone\u2019 but lingering: As Biden vows \u2018America is back,\u2019 allies wonder for how long</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The goodwill generated by his election, as well as by his initial statements about America's renewed international engagement, has all been evaporated,\" said Brett Bruen, a former foreign service officer who worked on global engagement in the Obama administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president acknowledged that \"no democracy is perfect, including the United States,\" but he said the country would \"continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diplomatic rough patch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House bristled at criticism that Biden will have to rebuild U.S. credibility in New York this week. A senior administration official insisted before the U.N. speech that the \"picture is actually quite positive\" despite the American exit from Afghanistan and the diplomatic spat with Paris.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's important to note that criticism of a decision is different from criticism of the credibility and leadership of the United States,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday before Biden's speech. \"And if you look back through the course of the last several decades prior to the last administration, there are points of disagreement, including when we have disagreed with the decisions other countries are making, when countries have disagreed with the decisions we're making.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Biden may aspire to be a transformative president abroad to course-correct his predecessor's policies, no single foreign policy issue is more critical than the crises he faces at home, according to Miller.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aides have repeatedly said the president's focus is ending the pandemic and reviving the U.S. economy, but Biden's legacy will also be shaped by whether Congress will pass his infrastructure plan and a spending package that would expand the social safety net \u2013 two bills that Democrats vowed to bring to a vote by the end of the month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He understands that his bandwidth for pursuing grandiose foreign policy and transformative adventures abroad is very limited because governance is about choosing,\" Miller said. \"He understands that the choices are much more consequential at home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lyon said Biden's recent foreign policy moves underscore the president's long-term strategic plan to counter the rise of China as a global power. The hasty Afghanistan exit was about consolidating resources and cutting ties to foreign wars, she said, and the Australian submarine contract is more about Beijing than a slight to the French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That contradicts what Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman envisioned in the creation of the United Nations after World War II, according to Lyon. She said they thought the best way to counter global threats would be to work together through a global institution devoted to peace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's an explanation (for Biden's actions), but it's not one that supports the agenda of the United Nations,\" Lyon said. \"We're working on our second administration that the Americans generally aren't necessarily committed to working with us, and that's what Biden has to overcome.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contributing: Michael Collins</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden to UN: US is shifting from 'relentless war' to relentless diplomacy' amid COVID-19, climate change crises\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}
