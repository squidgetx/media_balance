As a professional snowboarder, I\u2019ve ridden the steepest mountains in the world and spent weeks outside on foot-powered expeditions. Today I live in Truckee, a mountain town tucked into California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where I share my love of mountains with my wife and children. When we watch the Olympics, it still makes me joyous, but these days I also feel a little wistful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the world celebrates the achievements of athletes gliding over, down and across snow, I\u2019ve been reflecting on what I see in the mountains and for the future of these very Games. And for good reason. A team of researchers led by scientists at the University of Waterloo has found that if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not significantly reduced, only eight of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics will be cold enough to reliably do so again by the end of this century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Closer to home, the snowpack in the Sierra is at just 14 percent of the historical average. I never imagined I would see this in the middle of February.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The past three years were the hottest ever measured since record-keeping began in 1880, with 2016 ranking No. 1, followed by 2015 and 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists are warning us that the winter is becoming shorter . First freezes are starting later . So when I look at my children, I am even more convinced that we must take immediate and aggressive action on climate if we want their generation to learn these sports and enjoy winters in the mountains. More important, we must act quickly to preserve the culture and economies that depend on winter and snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report to be released this month by the group Protect Our Winters , which I founded, shows that tens of thousands of jobs are at stake in mountain towns as our climate warms. In total, the 191,000 jobs supported by snow sports in the 2015-16 winter season generated $6.9 billion in wages, while adding $11.3 billion in economic value to the national economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While a big snow season\u2019s economic boost is helpful, research shows that low snow years are disproportionately devastating, causing a combined annual revenue loss of $1 billion and 17,400 fewer jobs. These mountain towns are also the training grounds for American Olympians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All you have to do is watch the downhill race at Pyeongchang to know that snow-sports athletes don\u2019t just sit on their hands when faced with obstacles. That\u2019s why thousands of professional athletes, outdoor industry leaders, people who live in the mountains and those who live to ski and ride are joining forces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In person, through social media, in the streets and on Capitol Hill, we are letting our representatives know that believing in job creation and local economies means stepping up on legislation that supports renewable energy and places a price on carbon dioxide emissions. About 20 million people participate in winter sports every year. And many of them vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators in states with vital mountain economies love to talk about jobs. These people include Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Dean Heller of Nevada, both Republicans, along with representatives of congressional districts that include mountain towns, like Greg Walden of Oregon, Scott Tipton and Mike Coffman of Colorado, and my district\u2019s representative, Tom McClintock \u2014 Republicans as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the time comes to choose, these elected officials vote for legislation that will increase greenhouse gas emissions while ignoring the real threat to jobs in their own backyards \u2014 climate change. (Senator Gardner has a lifetime voting score from the League of Conservation Voters of 11 percent; Senator Heller\u2019s score is 13 percent. The top score among the representatives was 9 percent.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fossil fuel economy that they are voting to subsidize at substantial expense, both financial and environmental, won\u2019t last, and the sooner we move to renewable energy technologies, the better off we\u2019ll be. Our mountain economies still have a fighting chance, and we will fight for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/saving-winter-is-more-than-about-snow-its-about-jobs.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JEREMY JONES\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

As Arctic sea ice declines in response to warming temperatures, polar bears must fast for longer periods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prolonged fasting periods have been linked to reduced body condition, reproduction and survival in some polar bear populations, the study found. Continued sea ice loss ultimately threatens polar bear survival Arctic-wide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy \u2013 and inspiring action,\u201d said the University of Wyoming's Steven Amstrup, who conceived the project and is a co-author of the study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amstrup is also the chief scientist at Polar Bears International, a conservation organization dedicated to polar bears.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The authors modeled polar bear survival under a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario, which, if it occurs, would mean that all but a few polar bear populations would collapse by 2100, the study found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all,\u201d said Amstrup.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Recent Siberian heat wave 'almost impossible' without climate change, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read this: Arctic will see ice-free summers by 2050 as globe warms, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Climate change may push polar bears to the brink of extinction within 100 years, study says\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

It cost more than $300,000 -- thanks, Google's Sergey Brin -- and didn't taste very good. But the texture was right, and it saved a cow. Maybe one day it can save the Earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the real play behind the test-tube burgers. The hope, according to Dutch scientist Mark Post, who led the team, is that they can eventually help stop global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for moving away from raising and slaughtering animals for food is typically portrayed in terms of animal welfare. But increasingly the argument is about planetary welfare: Meat is simply a huge, huge contributor to climate change, and it's only going to get bigger as the billions of people in emerging economies begin demanding the meat-heavy diets they associate with wealth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this 2009 column, I laid out some of the numbers behind this debate. They're worth thinking about today. The column is slightly edited from its original version.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a 2006 United Nations report, livestock accounts for 18 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. That's larger than the entire transportation sector. Burgers, in other words, are doing more damage to the planet than SUVs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of meat's contribution to climate change is intuitive. It's more energy efficient to grow grain and feed it to people than it is to grow grain and turn it into feed that we give to calves until they become adults that we then slaughter to feed to people. Some of the contribution is gross. \"Manure lagoons,\" for instance, is the oddly evocative name for the acres of animal excrement that sit in the sun steaming nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. And some of it would make Bart Simpson chuckle. Cow gas -- interestingly, it's mainly burps, not flatulence -- is a real player.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the result isn't funny at all: Two researchers at the University of Chicago estimated that switching to a vegan diet would have a bigger impact than trading in your gas guzzler for a Prius (PDF). A study out of Carnegie Mellon University found that the average American would do less for the planet by switching to a totally local diet than by going vegetarian one day a week. That prompted Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to recommend that people give up meat one day a week to take pressure off the atmosphere. The response was quick and vicious. \"How convenient for him,\" was the inexplicable reply from a columnist at the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. \"He's a vegetarian.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The visceral reaction against anyone questioning our God-given right to bathe in bacon has been enough to scare many in the environmental movement away from this issue. The National Resources Defense Council has a long page of suggestions for how you, too, can \"fight global warming.\" As you'd expect, \"Drive Less\" is in bold letters. There's also an endorsement for \"high-mileage cars such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\" They advise that you weatherize your home, upgrade to more efficient appliances and even buy carbon offsets. The word \"meat\" is nowhere to be found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not an oversight. Telling people to give up burgers doesn't poll well. Ben Adler, an urban policy writer, explored that in a December 2008 article for the American Prospect. He called environmental groups and asked them for their policy on meat consumption. \"The Sierra Club isn't opposed to eating meat,\" was the clipped reply from a Sierra Club spokesman. \"So that's sort of the long and short of it.\" And without pressure to address the costs of meat, politicians predictably are whiffing on the issue. The Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, for instance, does nothing to address the emissions from livestock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pity of it is that compared with cars or appliances or heating your house, eating pasta on a night when you'd otherwise have made fajitas is easy. It doesn't require a long commute on the bus or the disposable income to trade up to a Prius. It doesn't mean you have to scrounge for change to buy a carbon offset. In fact, it saves money. It's healthful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it can be done immediately. A Montanan who drives 40 miles to work might not have the option to take public transportation. But he or she can probably pull off a veggie stew. A cash-strapped family might not be able buy a new dishwasher. But it might be able to replace meatballs with mac-and-cheese. That is the whole point behind the cheery PB&J Campaign, which reminds that \"you can fight global warming by having a PB&J for lunch.\" Given that PB&J is delicious, it's not the world's most onerous commitment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also worth saying that this is not a call for asceticism. It's not a value judgment on anyone's choices. Going vegetarian might not be as effective as going vegan, but it's better than eating meat, and eating meat less is better than eating meat more. It would be a whole lot better for the planet if everyone eliminated one meat meal a week than if a small core of die-hards developed perfectly virtuous diets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, if scientists could come up with an affordable, tasty meat that grows in a lab and doesn't impose much cost on the planet -- well, that might be the easiest solution of all.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 10}

Their sturdy roots clung to the crumbling mountainside. Their gnarled limbs reached toward the desert sky. The rings of their trunks told the story of everything they'd witnessed \u2014 every attack they'd rebuffed, every crisis they'd endured. Weather patterns shifted; empires rose and fell; other species emerged, mated, migrated, died. But here, in one of the harshest environments on the planet, the bristlecone pines survived. It seemed they always would.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the day in 2018 when Constance Millar ascended the trail to Telescope Peak \u2014 the highest point in Death Valley National Park \u2014 and discovered hundreds of dead and dying bristlecones extending as far as she could see.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trees' needles glowed a flaming orange; their bark was a ghostly gray. Millar estimated that the damage encompassed 60 to 70 percent of the bristlecones on Telescope Peak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's like coming across a murder scene,\" said Millar, an emerita research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service who has studied bristlecone pines for the better part of 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a study published this spring, she and fellow researchers showed that the West's worst drought in at least 1,200 years had critically weakened the trees. Voracious bark beetles \u2014 a threat to which bristlecones were previously thought immune \u2014 delivered the death blow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After outlasting millennia of disruptions and disaster, human-caused climate change is proving too much for the ancient trees to bear. Rising temperatures have caused an explosion in the populations of insects that threaten the trees and undermined their capacity to defend themselves, scientists say. Although Great Basin bristlecone pines are not considered at risk of extinction, cherished specimens and distinctive populations are struggling to survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And bristlecones are not the only victims. At this very moment, a fast-moving fire is scorching through the iconic giant sequoia grove in Yosemite National Park. Cedars are choking on saltwater as rising seas engulf shorelines on the East Coast. A rare oak species clings to life as the Texas desert grows hotter and drier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that climate change has pushed almost a quarter of Earth's best-protected forests to a \"critical threshold\" for lost resilience \u2014 the point at which even a minor drought or heat wave could tip them into catastrophic decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Standing amid the devastation atop Telescope Peak, Millar realized, \"This could be a harbinger of what could be happening in the future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If nature's consummate survivors could not cope with catastrophic warming, she wondered, what did that mean for the rest of life on this planet?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And if humanity didn't heed the warnings of these fallen elders, what would it say about us?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Prehistoric jewels\u2019</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No organism on Earth is known to live as long as the Great Basin bristlecone pine. The oldest documented tree, a well-hidden specimen nicknamed \"Methuselah,\" after the long-lived biblical patriarch, was a sapling when the ancient Egyptians built their pyramids more than 4,500 years ago. Even the relatively youthful trees in Death Valley are older than gunpowder, paper money and the English language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Their presence and their stability and their fortitude stretches our own sense of time,\" Millar said. \"It just slows people down ... and reminds us of how things were before humans were here.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The secret to their survival is their ability to withstand what others cannot. They exist at higher elevations than almost any other tree, thriving in the rocky, meager soils near rugged mountain peaks. Their branching root systems and waxy needles help them make the most of scant water. They produce a thick resin that traps insect invaders and quickly patches wounds. Their genomes, which are nine times as long as a human's, contain a multitude of mutations that give them a better chance of adapting to changing conditions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Few trees can take a beating like a bristlecone. They deal with crisis by sectioning off parts of their structures, enabling the rest of the tree to keep living while the injured limb is allowed to die. Their wood is so dense it rarely rots; the trunks of dead trees will remain standing for millennia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The species needs all these strengths to exist in Death Valley \u2014 a forbidding environment even by bristlecone standards. The park is further south than any other bristlecone habitat, and hotter and drier than any other place in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scores of other creatures benefit from the trees' persistence, Millar said. Bristlecones provide shade to elk and bighorn sheep, and shelter chipmunks and jack rabbits from predators and fierce weather. They allow snow to cling longer to the mountains' upper slopes, ensuring a supply of meltwater during the brutal summer months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And their staying power makes them invaluable to scientists. Bristlecone tree rings have allowed researchers to reconstruct a record of Earth's climate going back thousands of years; the field of research is known as \"dendrochronology.\" The rings reveal when volcanic eruptions occurred, how long droughts lasted, even when the surface of the sun became blotted by magnetic storms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"By translating the story told by tree rings, we have pushed back the horizons of history,\" the pioneering dendrochronologist Andrew Ellicott Douglass wrote in National Geographic in 1929.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He compared tree ring records to the Rosetta stone and called the ancient trees of the desert Southwest \"prehistoric jewels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In preserving the planet's past, bristlecones also have given humans a key to understanding our future. They capture the interactions between greenhouse gases, rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns and altered ecosystems, and they allow scientists to project what will happen as Earth continues to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's well spelled out that the loss of these trees would remove this natural archive,\" Millar said. \"I hope the general public will realize what a loss that would be.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A death on our watch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After her grisly discovery atop Telescope Peak, Millar immediately contacted Barbara Bentz, a research entomologist for the Forest Service based at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Logan, Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just a few years earlier, Bentz had surveyed bristlecone populations across the West and found that few were succumbing to the bark beetle outbreaks that decimated so many other species. She felt confident that the trees would remain resilient even as rising temperatures caused beetle populations to explode.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, when Bentz peeled a piece of bark off one of the Death Valley bristlecones, she found scores of tiny tunnels created by beetle larvae as the insects chewed through the tree's living tissue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Oh, no,\" Bentz thought to herself. \"It really is beetles. Oh, no.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She and her colleagues uncovered further evidence of insect damage in Utah's Wah Wah Mountains, where young bristlecones were attacked by a small brown beetle called a pinyon ips.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the beetles were unable to complete their life cycles inside bristlecone pines, Bentz said. Instead, it seemed that they were reproducing in nearby trees from a species different from the bristlecone. Higher temperatures \u2014 Inyo County, home to Death Valley, is already more than 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than in the preindustrial era \u2014 allowed the beetles to reproduce faster and caused their populations to swell dramatically. When the surplus spilled over into bristlecones, their defenses were overwhelmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scientists think the trees had been so stressed by drought that they could not fend off attacks they once would have vanquished with ease. Climate analyses showed that 2020 soil moisture levels in Death Valley and the Wah Wah range dipped to their lowest levels in at least 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar said the discovery should raise alarms all over the West, where lakes are shrinking, snowpacks are declining and heat records are being set. The White Mountains \u2014 home to Methuselah and many more of the world's oldest bristlecones \u2014 lie just 100 miles from Death Valley and have a similar climate. They could easily become the next site of a beetle attack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't want Methuselah to die on our watch,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the species is not considered at risk of extinction, she added, the death of important subpopulations is still a reason to mourn. Each disappearance not only represents a loss for the landscape, but also is a sacrifice of the genetic diversity those populations contained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar recalled another visit to Death Valley, when she hiked through an area called the Last Chance Range in search of a bristlecone pine cluster that was rumored still to exist there. By the time she found a single remaining tree, it was dead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the specimen had a gene that made it uniquely capable of surviving in that forbidding landscape, there was no chance of resurrecting it. No hope of collecting seeds for replanting, or taking a cutting in an attempt to produce clones. No opportunity to draw on the tree's DNA to help the rest of the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That, to me, is the dramatic element of watching a population go extinct,\" Millar said. All of that unique genetic material, the product of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution, is gone for good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arid forests around the globe have experienced a devastating loss of resilience in the past two decades, according to the analysis published Wednesday in Nature. Satellite imagery shows that these ecosystems are less able to bounce back after fluctuations in weather or periods of drought. Tropical and temperate forests \u2014 the steamy Amazon, the North Woods of Minnesota \u2014 are in similar decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trend was seen in forests altered by human activities as well as those that remain almost untouched by direct human action \u2014 an indication that climate change, rather than local deforestation or pollution, is primarily at fault.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, 23 percent of untouched forests are approaching the point at which they could be pushed into an abrupt and irreversible transition, the scientists said. Rainforest could turn into grassland. Thick stands of pine might give way to shrubs and desert.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a strong warning, I think, for society,\" said Giovanni Forzieri, a professor of sustainable development and climate change at the University of Florence and lead author of the Nature study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He pointed out that most of the world's climate plans count on forests to pull planet-warming gases out of the atmosphere. If these ecosystems collapse, humanity will find it difficult, if not impossible, to stave off catastrophic warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Averting extinction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Murphy Westwood, the vice president for science and conservation at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois, each loss feels like a moral failing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's overwhelming and almost crushing,\" she said, \"the stark reality of the biodiversity crisis that's on our hands.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, Westwood helped publish a sweeping assessment of 58,497 tree species worldwide that found that nearly 30 percent are at risk of being wiped out. At least 142 species have gone extinct in the wild.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just trees. With global temperatures already more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than in the preindustrial era, the Earth is losing species at a rate hundreds to thousands of times faster than normal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the world remains on its current warming track, as much as 29 percent of all creatures on land will face very high risk of extinction. In the ocean, the destruction will be even greater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But humanity's growing understanding of all we might lose, Westwood said, also offers us a chance to change course. We can conserve rare organisms and protect fragile ecosystems. We can reverse deforestation and stop burning the fossil fuels that cause the planet to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we can see it happening in front of our very eyes,\" she said, \"then we know we have the tools and knowledge to prevent another extinction.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She pointed to an expedition she helped direct this spring, which rediscovered a tree that scientists had believed to be extinct.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures and dwindling water over the past century had killed off every known specimen of Quercus tardifolia, an oak known for its fuzzy evergreen leaves. But Westwood and other scientists held out hope that the species still clung to existence somewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After weeks of trekking through the canyons of Big Bend National Park in Texas, they stumbled upon a single tardifolia tree \u2014 scorched by fire and ravaged by fungal disease but undeniably, miraculously, alive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The researchers plan to collect acorns and cuttings from the tree that can be used to regrow the species in botanic gardens and arboretums.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a second chance to prevent a species extinction,\" said Wes Knapp, the chief botanist for the conservation nonprofit NatureServe and another member of the expedition. \"That's really rare, to have a second chance in nature. It means we can move. We can act. That's what we have to do now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further west, Millar and Bentz plan to return to Death Valley this August to more thoroughly assess the state of the park's bristlecone pines and then develop strategies for preserving the trees that remain. They are developing chemical repellents based on the trees' natural defenses to protect \"high-value trees,\" such as Methuselah. And they are surveying all the nation's bristlecone stands, searching for the genetic variations that might help the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the challenges facing both trees and humanity, Millar said, the bristlecones offer lessons in how to hang on. Their tenacity is an antidote to despair. Their genetic diversity is a bulwark as they face the unknown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"From a human standpoint, I think that translates into innovation and resilience,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To live like a bristlecone is to never let go of hope.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

This, like all his policies, is, he says, climate policy, and serves racial \"equity\" (by improving urban air quality).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the White House calls a \"fact sheet\" says Biden's administration will \"support market demand\" for EVs by \"driving demand\" with \"point-of-sale incentives\" to encourage \"deployment\" of EVs. Translation: Subsidies, including tax credits for purchasers, will fiddle the market by lowering EV prices enough to manufacture a demand sufficient to justify manufacturing the vehicles in quantities that the administration says are vital for the planet. Biden even wants $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations. When U.S. automobile sales exploded from 8 million vehicles on U.S. roads in 1920 to 23 million in 1930 without tax credits, the private sector, responding to real rather than synthetic demand, built sufficient gas stations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchasers, until a manufacturer sells 200,000. GM and Tesla have reached this cap. GM wants the tax credit restored and made permanent. Internal Revenue Service data for 2014 showed that the biggest beneficiaries were households with adjusted gross income of at least $100,000. One percent went to households earning less than $50,000. States, too, have joined the market manipulation. In California, where about 47 percent of EVs are sold, buyers can gain up to $15,000. That such subsidies \"work\" is shown by what happens when they end: In 2015, when Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit, EV sales plummeted 89 percent in two months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's policy to use less affluent Americans' money to entice more affluent Americans to buy EVs is only one of the contemplated regressive policies by which his administration would transfer wealth upward. Another such policy would cancel student debts for some of the fortunate minority of Americans who, having college degrees, will likely enjoy lifetime earnings significantly higher than those of the less fortunate majority. And if Democrats repeal the $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes by individuals filing their federal income taxes, this would almost entirely benefit very wealthy taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But desperate times require desperate measures, and Earth, the administration says, desperately needs EVs. For reasons unrelated to climate change \u2014 including cost and convenience \u2014 the future of EVs probably would be bright even without government midwifery. Perhaps, however, these should be called \"19.3 percent coal cars,\" that being the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal. Furthermore, Bjorn Lomborg, a climate writer, notes, EVs require large batteries that \"are often produced in China using coal power. According to the [International Energy Agency], just producing the battery for an electric car can emit almost a quarter as much of the greenhouse gases that a gasoline car will emit across its entire lifetime.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama-Biden administration \"Cash for Clunkers\" tried to meld economic stimulus and environmental stewardship. Consumers trading in old vehicles received vouchers for more climate-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 vouchers for $3,500 or $4,500, depending on the miles-per-gallon difference between trade-in and the new purchase. A Brookings Institution study found that the 55-day program's $2.85 billion essentially shifted \"roughly a few billion [consumers'] dollars forward from the subsequent two quarters following the program.\" Most of the 677,842 sales \u2014 that many clunkers were traded in and, as required by law, destroyed \u2014 were just \"slightly earlier [purchases] than otherwise would have occurred.\" They did create some jobs \u2014 at a cost of $1.4 million each.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, whose environmentally responsible recycling extends to recycling threadbare ideas, proposes $392 billion for 10 years of tax credits and vouchers for those who replace gas-powered vehicles with EVs. Biden wants to recycle the $7,500 EV tax credit. All such measures will have a climate impact too tiny to measure, given that U.S. personal cars, of which EVs will be a small proportion for many years, produce only 2.4 percent of global emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1928, presidential candidate Herbert Hoover's supporters said Republicans had put \"the proverbial 'chicken in every pot.' And a car in every backyard, to boot.\" Biden should promise coq au vin on every plate and two Teslas in every garage. Progress, or at least progressivism, is inexorable.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}
