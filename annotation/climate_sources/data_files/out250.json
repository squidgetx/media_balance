As a professional snowboarder, I\u2019ve ridden the steepest mountains in the world and spent weeks outside on foot-powered expeditions. Today I live in Truckee, a mountain town tucked into California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where I share my love of mountains with my wife and children. When we watch the Olympics, it still makes me joyous, but these days I also feel a little wistful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the world celebrates the achievements of athletes gliding over, down and across snow, I\u2019ve been reflecting on what I see in the mountains and for the future of these very Games. And for good reason. A team of researchers led by scientists at the University of Waterloo has found that if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not significantly reduced, only eight of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics will be cold enough to reliably do so again by the end of this century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Closer to home, the snowpack in the Sierra is at just 14 percent of the historical average. I never imagined I would see this in the middle of February.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The past three years were the hottest ever measured since record-keeping began in 1880, with 2016 ranking No. 1, followed by 2015 and 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists are warning us that the winter is becoming shorter . First freezes are starting later . So when I look at my children, I am even more convinced that we must take immediate and aggressive action on climate if we want their generation to learn these sports and enjoy winters in the mountains. More important, we must act quickly to preserve the culture and economies that depend on winter and snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report to be released this month by the group Protect Our Winters , which I founded, shows that tens of thousands of jobs are at stake in mountain towns as our climate warms. In total, the 191,000 jobs supported by snow sports in the 2015-16 winter season generated $6.9 billion in wages, while adding $11.3 billion in economic value to the national economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While a big snow season\u2019s economic boost is helpful, research shows that low snow years are disproportionately devastating, causing a combined annual revenue loss of $1 billion and 17,400 fewer jobs. These mountain towns are also the training grounds for American Olympians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All you have to do is watch the downhill race at Pyeongchang to know that snow-sports athletes don\u2019t just sit on their hands when faced with obstacles. That\u2019s why thousands of professional athletes, outdoor industry leaders, people who live in the mountains and those who live to ski and ride are joining forces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In person, through social media, in the streets and on Capitol Hill, we are letting our representatives know that believing in job creation and local economies means stepping up on legislation that supports renewable energy and places a price on carbon dioxide emissions. About 20 million people participate in winter sports every year. And many of them vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators in states with vital mountain economies love to talk about jobs. These people include Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Dean Heller of Nevada, both Republicans, along with representatives of congressional districts that include mountain towns, like Greg Walden of Oregon, Scott Tipton and Mike Coffman of Colorado, and my district\u2019s representative, Tom McClintock \u2014 Republicans as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the time comes to choose, these elected officials vote for legislation that will increase greenhouse gas emissions while ignoring the real threat to jobs in their own backyards \u2014 climate change. (Senator Gardner has a lifetime voting score from the League of Conservation Voters of 11 percent; Senator Heller\u2019s score is 13 percent. The top score among the representatives was 9 percent.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fossil fuel economy that they are voting to subsidize at substantial expense, both financial and environmental, won\u2019t last, and the sooner we move to renewable energy technologies, the better off we\u2019ll be. Our mountain economies still have a fighting chance, and we will fight for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/saving-winter-is-more-than-about-snow-its-about-jobs.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JEREMY JONES\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

As Arctic sea ice declines in response to warming temperatures, polar bears must fast for longer periods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prolonged fasting periods have been linked to reduced body condition, reproduction and survival in some polar bear populations, the study found. Continued sea ice loss ultimately threatens polar bear survival Arctic-wide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy \u2013 and inspiring action,\u201d said the University of Wyoming's Steven Amstrup, who conceived the project and is a co-author of the study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amstrup is also the chief scientist at Polar Bears International, a conservation organization dedicated to polar bears.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The authors modeled polar bear survival under a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario, which, if it occurs, would mean that all but a few polar bear populations would collapse by 2100, the study found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all,\u201d said Amstrup.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Recent Siberian heat wave 'almost impossible' without climate change, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read this: Arctic will see ice-free summers by 2050 as globe warms, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Climate change may push polar bears to the brink of extinction within 100 years, study says\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

It cost more than $300,000 -- thanks, Google's Sergey Brin -- and didn't taste very good. But the texture was right, and it saved a cow. Maybe one day it can save the Earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the real play behind the test-tube burgers. The hope, according to Dutch scientist Mark Post, who led the team, is that they can eventually help stop global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for moving away from raising and slaughtering animals for food is typically portrayed in terms of animal welfare. But increasingly the argument is about planetary welfare: Meat is simply a huge, huge contributor to climate change, and it's only going to get bigger as the billions of people in emerging economies begin demanding the meat-heavy diets they associate with wealth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this 2009 column, I laid out some of the numbers behind this debate. They're worth thinking about today. The column is slightly edited from its original version.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a 2006 United Nations report, livestock accounts for 18 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. That's larger than the entire transportation sector. Burgers, in other words, are doing more damage to the planet than SUVs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of meat's contribution to climate change is intuitive. It's more energy efficient to grow grain and feed it to people than it is to grow grain and turn it into feed that we give to calves until they become adults that we then slaughter to feed to people. Some of the contribution is gross. \"Manure lagoons,\" for instance, is the oddly evocative name for the acres of animal excrement that sit in the sun steaming nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. And some of it would make Bart Simpson chuckle. Cow gas -- interestingly, it's mainly burps, not flatulence -- is a real player.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the result isn't funny at all: Two researchers at the University of Chicago estimated that switching to a vegan diet would have a bigger impact than trading in your gas guzzler for a Prius (PDF). A study out of Carnegie Mellon University found that the average American would do less for the planet by switching to a totally local diet than by going vegetarian one day a week. That prompted Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to recommend that people give up meat one day a week to take pressure off the atmosphere. The response was quick and vicious. \"How convenient for him,\" was the inexplicable reply from a columnist at the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. \"He's a vegetarian.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The visceral reaction against anyone questioning our God-given right to bathe in bacon has been enough to scare many in the environmental movement away from this issue. The National Resources Defense Council has a long page of suggestions for how you, too, can \"fight global warming.\" As you'd expect, \"Drive Less\" is in bold letters. There's also an endorsement for \"high-mileage cars such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\" They advise that you weatherize your home, upgrade to more efficient appliances and even buy carbon offsets. The word \"meat\" is nowhere to be found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not an oversight. Telling people to give up burgers doesn't poll well. Ben Adler, an urban policy writer, explored that in a December 2008 article for the American Prospect. He called environmental groups and asked them for their policy on meat consumption. \"The Sierra Club isn't opposed to eating meat,\" was the clipped reply from a Sierra Club spokesman. \"So that's sort of the long and short of it.\" And without pressure to address the costs of meat, politicians predictably are whiffing on the issue. The Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, for instance, does nothing to address the emissions from livestock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pity of it is that compared with cars or appliances or heating your house, eating pasta on a night when you'd otherwise have made fajitas is easy. It doesn't require a long commute on the bus or the disposable income to trade up to a Prius. It doesn't mean you have to scrounge for change to buy a carbon offset. In fact, it saves money. It's healthful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it can be done immediately. A Montanan who drives 40 miles to work might not have the option to take public transportation. But he or she can probably pull off a veggie stew. A cash-strapped family might not be able buy a new dishwasher. But it might be able to replace meatballs with mac-and-cheese. That is the whole point behind the cheery PB&J Campaign, which reminds that \"you can fight global warming by having a PB&J for lunch.\" Given that PB&J is delicious, it's not the world's most onerous commitment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also worth saying that this is not a call for asceticism. It's not a value judgment on anyone's choices. Going vegetarian might not be as effective as going vegan, but it's better than eating meat, and eating meat less is better than eating meat more. It would be a whole lot better for the planet if everyone eliminated one meat meal a week than if a small core of die-hards developed perfectly virtuous diets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, if scientists could come up with an affordable, tasty meat that grows in a lab and doesn't impose much cost on the planet -- well, that might be the easiest solution of all.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

Their sturdy roots clung to the crumbling mountainside. Their gnarled limbs reached toward the desert sky. The rings of their trunks told the story of everything they'd witnessed \u2014 every attack they'd rebuffed, every crisis they'd endured. Weather patterns shifted; empires rose and fell; other species emerged, mated, migrated, died. But here, in one of the harshest environments on the planet, the bristlecone pines survived. It seemed they always would.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the day in 2018 when Constance Millar ascended the trail to Telescope Peak \u2014 the highest point in Death Valley National Park \u2014 and discovered hundreds of dead and dying bristlecones extending as far as she could see.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trees' needles glowed a flaming orange; their bark was a ghostly gray. Millar estimated that the damage encompassed 60 to 70 percent of the bristlecones on Telescope Peak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's like coming across a murder scene,\" said Millar, an emerita research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service who has studied bristlecone pines for the better part of 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a study published this spring, she and fellow researchers showed that the West's worst drought in at least 1,200 years had critically weakened the trees. Voracious bark beetles \u2014 a threat to which bristlecones were previously thought immune \u2014 delivered the death blow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After outlasting millennia of disruptions and disaster, human-caused climate change is proving too much for the ancient trees to bear. Rising temperatures have caused an explosion in the populations of insects that threaten the trees and undermined their capacity to defend themselves, scientists say. Although Great Basin bristlecone pines are not considered at risk of extinction, cherished specimens and distinctive populations are struggling to survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And bristlecones are not the only victims. At this very moment, a fast-moving fire is scorching through the iconic giant sequoia grove in Yosemite National Park. Cedars are choking on saltwater as rising seas engulf shorelines on the East Coast. A rare oak species clings to life as the Texas desert grows hotter and drier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that climate change has pushed almost a quarter of Earth's best-protected forests to a \"critical threshold\" for lost resilience \u2014 the point at which even a minor drought or heat wave could tip them into catastrophic decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Standing amid the devastation atop Telescope Peak, Millar realized, \"This could be a harbinger of what could be happening in the future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If nature's consummate survivors could not cope with catastrophic warming, she wondered, what did that mean for the rest of life on this planet?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And if humanity didn't heed the warnings of these fallen elders, what would it say about us?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Prehistoric jewels\u2019</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No organism on Earth is known to live as long as the Great Basin bristlecone pine. The oldest documented tree, a well-hidden specimen nicknamed \"Methuselah,\" after the long-lived biblical patriarch, was a sapling when the ancient Egyptians built their pyramids more than 4,500 years ago. Even the relatively youthful trees in Death Valley are older than gunpowder, paper money and the English language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Their presence and their stability and their fortitude stretches our own sense of time,\" Millar said. \"It just slows people down ... and reminds us of how things were before humans were here.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The secret to their survival is their ability to withstand what others cannot. They exist at higher elevations than almost any other tree, thriving in the rocky, meager soils near rugged mountain peaks. Their branching root systems and waxy needles help them make the most of scant water. They produce a thick resin that traps insect invaders and quickly patches wounds. Their genomes, which are nine times as long as a human's, contain a multitude of mutations that give them a better chance of adapting to changing conditions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Few trees can take a beating like a bristlecone. They deal with crisis by sectioning off parts of their structures, enabling the rest of the tree to keep living while the injured limb is allowed to die. Their wood is so dense it rarely rots; the trunks of dead trees will remain standing for millennia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The species needs all these strengths to exist in Death Valley \u2014 a forbidding environment even by bristlecone standards. The park is further south than any other bristlecone habitat, and hotter and drier than any other place in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scores of other creatures benefit from the trees' persistence, Millar said. Bristlecones provide shade to elk and bighorn sheep, and shelter chipmunks and jack rabbits from predators and fierce weather. They allow snow to cling longer to the mountains' upper slopes, ensuring a supply of meltwater during the brutal summer months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And their staying power makes them invaluable to scientists. Bristlecone tree rings have allowed researchers to reconstruct a record of Earth's climate going back thousands of years; the field of research is known as \"dendrochronology.\" The rings reveal when volcanic eruptions occurred, how long droughts lasted, even when the surface of the sun became blotted by magnetic storms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"By translating the story told by tree rings, we have pushed back the horizons of history,\" the pioneering dendrochronologist Andrew Ellicott Douglass wrote in National Geographic in 1929.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He compared tree ring records to the Rosetta stone and called the ancient trees of the desert Southwest \"prehistoric jewels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In preserving the planet's past, bristlecones also have given humans a key to understanding our future. They capture the interactions between greenhouse gases, rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns and altered ecosystems, and they allow scientists to project what will happen as Earth continues to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's well spelled out that the loss of these trees would remove this natural archive,\" Millar said. \"I hope the general public will realize what a loss that would be.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A death on our watch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After her grisly discovery atop Telescope Peak, Millar immediately contacted Barbara Bentz, a research entomologist for the Forest Service based at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Logan, Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just a few years earlier, Bentz had surveyed bristlecone populations across the West and found that few were succumbing to the bark beetle outbreaks that decimated so many other species. She felt confident that the trees would remain resilient even as rising temperatures caused beetle populations to explode.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, when Bentz peeled a piece of bark off one of the Death Valley bristlecones, she found scores of tiny tunnels created by beetle larvae as the insects chewed through the tree's living tissue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Oh, no,\" Bentz thought to herself. \"It really is beetles. Oh, no.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She and her colleagues uncovered further evidence of insect damage in Utah's Wah Wah Mountains, where young bristlecones were attacked by a small brown beetle called a pinyon ips.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the beetles were unable to complete their life cycles inside bristlecone pines, Bentz said. Instead, it seemed that they were reproducing in nearby trees from a species different from the bristlecone. Higher temperatures \u2014 Inyo County, home to Death Valley, is already more than 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than in the preindustrial era \u2014 allowed the beetles to reproduce faster and caused their populations to swell dramatically. When the surplus spilled over into bristlecones, their defenses were overwhelmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scientists think the trees had been so stressed by drought that they could not fend off attacks they once would have vanquished with ease. Climate analyses showed that 2020 soil moisture levels in Death Valley and the Wah Wah range dipped to their lowest levels in at least 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar said the discovery should raise alarms all over the West, where lakes are shrinking, snowpacks are declining and heat records are being set. The White Mountains \u2014 home to Methuselah and many more of the world's oldest bristlecones \u2014 lie just 100 miles from Death Valley and have a similar climate. They could easily become the next site of a beetle attack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't want Methuselah to die on our watch,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the species is not considered at risk of extinction, she added, the death of important subpopulations is still a reason to mourn. Each disappearance not only represents a loss for the landscape, but also is a sacrifice of the genetic diversity those populations contained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar recalled another visit to Death Valley, when she hiked through an area called the Last Chance Range in search of a bristlecone pine cluster that was rumored still to exist there. By the time she found a single remaining tree, it was dead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the specimen had a gene that made it uniquely capable of surviving in that forbidding landscape, there was no chance of resurrecting it. No hope of collecting seeds for replanting, or taking a cutting in an attempt to produce clones. No opportunity to draw on the tree's DNA to help the rest of the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That, to me, is the dramatic element of watching a population go extinct,\" Millar said. All of that unique genetic material, the product of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution, is gone for good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arid forests around the globe have experienced a devastating loss of resilience in the past two decades, according to the analysis published Wednesday in Nature. Satellite imagery shows that these ecosystems are less able to bounce back after fluctuations in weather or periods of drought. Tropical and temperate forests \u2014 the steamy Amazon, the North Woods of Minnesota \u2014 are in similar decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trend was seen in forests altered by human activities as well as those that remain almost untouched by direct human action \u2014 an indication that climate change, rather than local deforestation or pollution, is primarily at fault.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, 23 percent of untouched forests are approaching the point at which they could be pushed into an abrupt and irreversible transition, the scientists said. Rainforest could turn into grassland. Thick stands of pine might give way to shrubs and desert.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a strong warning, I think, for society,\" said Giovanni Forzieri, a professor of sustainable development and climate change at the University of Florence and lead author of the Nature study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He pointed out that most of the world's climate plans count on forests to pull planet-warming gases out of the atmosphere. If these ecosystems collapse, humanity will find it difficult, if not impossible, to stave off catastrophic warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Averting extinction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Murphy Westwood, the vice president for science and conservation at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois, each loss feels like a moral failing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's overwhelming and almost crushing,\" she said, \"the stark reality of the biodiversity crisis that's on our hands.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, Westwood helped publish a sweeping assessment of 58,497 tree species worldwide that found that nearly 30 percent are at risk of being wiped out. At least 142 species have gone extinct in the wild.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just trees. With global temperatures already more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than in the preindustrial era, the Earth is losing species at a rate hundreds to thousands of times faster than normal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the world remains on its current warming track, as much as 29 percent of all creatures on land will face very high risk of extinction. In the ocean, the destruction will be even greater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But humanity's growing understanding of all we might lose, Westwood said, also offers us a chance to change course. We can conserve rare organisms and protect fragile ecosystems. We can reverse deforestation and stop burning the fossil fuels that cause the planet to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we can see it happening in front of our very eyes,\" she said, \"then we know we have the tools and knowledge to prevent another extinction.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She pointed to an expedition she helped direct this spring, which rediscovered a tree that scientists had believed to be extinct.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures and dwindling water over the past century had killed off every known specimen of Quercus tardifolia, an oak known for its fuzzy evergreen leaves. But Westwood and other scientists held out hope that the species still clung to existence somewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After weeks of trekking through the canyons of Big Bend National Park in Texas, they stumbled upon a single tardifolia tree \u2014 scorched by fire and ravaged by fungal disease but undeniably, miraculously, alive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The researchers plan to collect acorns and cuttings from the tree that can be used to regrow the species in botanic gardens and arboretums.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a second chance to prevent a species extinction,\" said Wes Knapp, the chief botanist for the conservation nonprofit NatureServe and another member of the expedition. \"That's really rare, to have a second chance in nature. It means we can move. We can act. That's what we have to do now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further west, Millar and Bentz plan to return to Death Valley this August to more thoroughly assess the state of the park's bristlecone pines and then develop strategies for preserving the trees that remain. They are developing chemical repellents based on the trees' natural defenses to protect \"high-value trees,\" such as Methuselah. And they are surveying all the nation's bristlecone stands, searching for the genetic variations that might help the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the challenges facing both trees and humanity, Millar said, the bristlecones offer lessons in how to hang on. Their tenacity is an antidote to despair. Their genetic diversity is a bulwark as they face the unknown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"From a human standpoint, I think that translates into innovation and resilience,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To live like a bristlecone is to never let go of hope.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

This, like all his policies, is, he says, climate policy, and serves racial \"equity\" (by improving urban air quality).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the White House calls a \"fact sheet\" says Biden's administration will \"support market demand\" for EVs by \"driving demand\" with \"point-of-sale incentives\" to encourage \"deployment\" of EVs. Translation: Subsidies, including tax credits for purchasers, will fiddle the market by lowering EV prices enough to manufacture a demand sufficient to justify manufacturing the vehicles in quantities that the administration says are vital for the planet. Biden even wants $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations. When U.S. automobile sales exploded from 8 million vehicles on U.S. roads in 1920 to 23 million in 1930 without tax credits, the private sector, responding to real rather than synthetic demand, built sufficient gas stations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchasers, until a manufacturer sells 200,000. GM and Tesla have reached this cap. GM wants the tax credit restored and made permanent. Internal Revenue Service data for 2014 showed that the biggest beneficiaries were households with adjusted gross income of at least $100,000. One percent went to households earning less than $50,000. States, too, have joined the market manipulation. In California, where about 47 percent of EVs are sold, buyers can gain up to $15,000. That such subsidies \"work\" is shown by what happens when they end: In 2015, when Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit, EV sales plummeted 89 percent in two months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's policy to use less affluent Americans' money to entice more affluent Americans to buy EVs is only one of the contemplated regressive policies by which his administration would transfer wealth upward. Another such policy would cancel student debts for some of the fortunate minority of Americans who, having college degrees, will likely enjoy lifetime earnings significantly higher than those of the less fortunate majority. And if Democrats repeal the $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes by individuals filing their federal income taxes, this would almost entirely benefit very wealthy taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But desperate times require desperate measures, and Earth, the administration says, desperately needs EVs. For reasons unrelated to climate change \u2014 including cost and convenience \u2014 the future of EVs probably would be bright even without government midwifery. Perhaps, however, these should be called \"19.3 percent coal cars,\" that being the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal. Furthermore, Bjorn Lomborg, a climate writer, notes, EVs require large batteries that \"are often produced in China using coal power. According to the [International Energy Agency], just producing the battery for an electric car can emit almost a quarter as much of the greenhouse gases that a gasoline car will emit across its entire lifetime.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama-Biden administration \"Cash for Clunkers\" tried to meld economic stimulus and environmental stewardship. Consumers trading in old vehicles received vouchers for more climate-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 vouchers for $3,500 or $4,500, depending on the miles-per-gallon difference between trade-in and the new purchase. A Brookings Institution study found that the 55-day program's $2.85 billion essentially shifted \"roughly a few billion [consumers'] dollars forward from the subsequent two quarters following the program.\" Most of the 677,842 sales \u2014 that many clunkers were traded in and, as required by law, destroyed \u2014 were just \"slightly earlier [purchases] than otherwise would have occurred.\" They did create some jobs \u2014 at a cost of $1.4 million each.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, whose environmentally responsible recycling extends to recycling threadbare ideas, proposes $392 billion for 10 years of tax credits and vouchers for those who replace gas-powered vehicles with EVs. Biden wants to recycle the $7,500 EV tax credit. All such measures will have a climate impact too tiny to measure, given that U.S. personal cars, of which EVs will be a small proportion for many years, produce only 2.4 percent of global emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1928, presidential candidate Herbert Hoover's supporters said Republicans had put \"the proverbial 'chicken in every pot.' And a car in every backyard, to boot.\" Biden should promise coq au vin on every plate and two Teslas in every garage. Progress, or at least progressivism, is inexorable.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Several companies are experimenting with new shipping methods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, a 24,000-liter hermetically sealed plastic container, or flexitank, carrying organically grown pinot grigio from Sicily arrived in a cargo container at Filling Station East, a wine packaging facility near the port in Bayonne, N.J.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The wine was for Gotham Project, a company that specializes in kegged wine, which it sells to bars and restaurants in almost 40 states. The Sicilian pinot grigio, the equivalent of about 32,000 750-milliliter bottles, was siphoned through a thick hose from the flexitank into a 6,400-gallon stainless steel tank. Eventually, it will fill kegs, cans and bottles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But those bottles will not be the ordinary single-use wine variety that should be recycled (but more likely get trashed). These Gotham Project bottles are intended to be reused multiple times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of returnable, reusable bottles is to cut down on waste, while reducing the carbon output of the wine industry, moves dictated by the necessity of combating climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers have known for at least a decade that the single largest portion of the carbon footprint of a bottle of wine comes from the energy used to manufacture that bottle, transport it to the winery to be filled and then distribute it around the globe for consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the need to reduce humanity\u2019s carbon production becomes more urgent, some in the wine industry have begun to examine alternatives to the long-accepted, energy-guzzling methods for bottling and shipping wine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that some of the best solutions may be old methods of shipping and packaging, long ago discarded, like bottles that can be returned, sanitized and reused 10 times or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project is one of a few companies experimenting with selling wine in returnable bottles. Gotham\u2019s look like sturdy Burgundy bottles, green glass for reds and clear for whites and ros\u00e9s. But they are embossed with \u201cReturn & Reuse\u201d and sealed solely with corks, avoiding the waste that would come with foil capsules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham is trying out the bottles with a small group of retailers and restaurants in three state: New York, Massachusetts and Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reusable bottles are a natural next step for a company that for more than a decade has promoted the use of its stainless steel wine kegs as a better, less wasteful method of selling wines by the glass in restaurants and bars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFirst and foremost, we care about how the wine tastes: Freshness was top of mind,\u201d said Bruce Schneider, who, with a partner, Charles Bieler, founded Gotham in 2010. \u201cThe second factor was carbon footprint and reducing packaging waste.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Schneider estimates that by selling wine in reusable stainless steel kegs, which each hold the equivalent of 26 750-milliliter bottles, Gotham has eliminated more than 5 million single-use glass bottles from being tossed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOver 3 billion bottles a year go to landfill,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cOnly around 30 percent of glass bottles are recycled in the U.S. It\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And because the kegs use inert gas to fill the empty space as wine is poured out through a tap, the wine is kept fresher than it would be in bottles, which might sit around half empty for several days in a restaurant, slowly oxidizing, before they are emptied. From Mr. Schneider\u2019s perspective, reusable bottles are a natural evolution. It\u2019s after all not a new technology. Older generations may still remember the early morning arrival of the milkman, who would leave fresh bottles and take away the empties, which the dairy would reuse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thick soda and seltzer bottles were likewise returned and reused. Shoppers at farmers\u2019 markets today may still encounter similar reusable bottles from local dairies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reusable bottles have a long history in wine, particularly in European wine regions, where even today shoppers might carry their own demijohns to a nearby wine shop or cooperative, to be filled from a tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, frugality largely gave way to convenience in the last third of the 20th century. Disposability became a virtue to the detriment of the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham is not the only company to introduce reusable wine bottles. Good Goods, a New York start-up, began testing its reusable bottle with 14 retailers around the country last year. Zach Lawless, the chief executive of Good Goods, says wine producers who are environmentally conscious in their farming and production have a special incentive to adopt the bottles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey put so much effort into their work, but consumers don\u2019t experience it,\u201d Mr. Lawless said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to put their mission into how their product is experienced.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply switching to reusable bottles could diminish the amount of glass thrown away, but it cannot reduce the carbon footprint appreciably unless the shipping angle is addressed as well. That\u2019s where the flexitank comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As cargo gets heavier, it requires more fuel to ship. Aside from the energy required to manufacture wine bottles, the bottles themselves are relatively heavy. Environmentally conscious producers understand this and have tried to shave off weight, using lighter bottles. Nonetheless, plenty of producers continue to opt for wasteful trophy bottles, relying on a tried-and-true formula in which consumers equate heavier bottles with higher quality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A far better solution would be to ship wine in bulk, using flexitanks, essentially giant plastic bladders within metal frames, rather than bottles, and then to bottle the wine close to where it will be sold. This cuts way down on the weight of shipping. Mr. Schneider estimated that the wine in the 24,000-liter flexitank, which fit into one shipping container, would have required three containers if the wine had been bottled before shipping.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shipping in bulk is nothing novel. Every year wine is sold in bulk, often by producers making inexpensive wine that will be sold elsewhere in the world under any number of proprietary labels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes producers whose supply of wine is diminished because of vintage conditions will check the bulk market to see what supplemental wine might be available. During the last series of drought years, sharp-eyed consumers may have spotted inexpensive California wine brands with labels citing sources like Argentina or Languedoc in the fine print.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conversely, some Napa and Sonoma producers who were concerned that the California wildfires last year might have tainted certain vineyards sold off the wines made from those grapes on the bulk market rather than bottle it under their own label.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project does not buy wine on the bulk market. Rather, under long-term agreements it buys directly from producers who farm organically or sustainably in Europe, South America, California and New York.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I tasted Beaujolais, California sauvignon blanc, ros\u00e9 from the south of France, Tuscan sangiovese and Finger Lakes cabernet franc, all packaged in Gotham\u2019s returnable bottles. Each was fresh, clean and unpretentious, all delightful, inexpensive wines that were a pleasure to drink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as returnable bottles are nothing new, neither is shipping fine wines in bulk. Right up through the 1960s, renowned Bordeaux producers used to ship their wines in barrels to Britain, where they would be bottled for sale by merchants. If you are ever lucky enough to stumble upon, say, an old 1950s Ch\u00e2teau Latour from the cellar of some old London club, chances are the label will cite the merchant as well as the producer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The British, by the way, are today far ahead of Americans in point-of-sale bottling. Jancis Robinson, the British wine writer, estimates that as much as 45 percent of all still wine imported into Britain arrives in bulk and is bottled there, generally by supermarkets that sell a great deal of inexpensive wine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not all wines can be bottled at the point of origin. Many appellations, like certain Riojas or Brunello di Montalcino, require that wines be aged for a certain period of time in bottles before they can be sold. But plenty of wines face no such impediments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Creating a reusable bottle system is not nearly so simple as asking people to return the bottles they buy. Of necessity, returnable bottles must be thicker and heavier than those intended for single use, horrifyingly so if they were to be shipped any long distance rather than being bottled and sold locally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They need to be sturdy enough to withstand repeated cleanings, along with being shipped back and forth from filling facility to distributor to retailer to merchant. (That\u2019s the three-tier system in action, as required by law. It uses a lot of extra fuel.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reusable bottles must also have labels that are easy to remove when cleaning, hearkening back to the days before mobile phones, when rather than photograph the label of a memorable wine, you steamed the label off and pasted it in a scrapbook. For its reusable bottles, Gotham had to employ an older form of water-soluble glue rather than the more common pressure-sensitive adhesives, which are far more difficult to remove.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While reusable bottles are laudable and idealistic, they are worthless if consumers don\u2019t hold up their end by returning them. When Good Goods first tested its reusable bottle last summer, Mr. Lawless said, only 25 percent of them were actually returned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In analyzing the problem, Mr. Lawless said they learned asking for a small deposit, to be returned when the bottles were brought back, was not a sufficient incentive for consumers to overcome their preference for disposability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when Good Goods switched from a deposit system to offering store credit for returning the bottles, Mr. Lawless said, compliance rose to 85 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFraming it as a reward rather than a deposit made a massive impact,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project, on the other hand, has not asked for a deposit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Gotham is testing an app that will give consumers a choice of receiving a small cash reward for returning bottles or donating that amount to an environmental charity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe are hoping people will do it because it is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Scheider said. \u201cBut we also believe an incentive will help.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These reusable bottles are just tiny steps toward confronting a huge problem of waste and energy consumption. They are not the only possible solutions, either. One company in Britain is testing lightweight, flat bottles made of recycled plastic. Bacardi and other companies are testing biodegradable bottles made of plant materials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What\u2019s clear is the current system of shipping heavy, throwaway bottles around the globe is unsustainable, as simple and familiar as it might be. Change may seem difficult and inconvenient, but it\u2019s necessary and in the long run easier to accept than an overheated planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Podesta on Monday touted the administration record on energy production as well as climate change, arguing Democrats can run this fall on the fact they have bolstered the nation's oil and gas industry while tackling global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Podesta ran through a series of slides at the daily press briefing that showed the United States is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world, as well as the largest producer of gas and oil combined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In 2012 and 2013, it accounted for .22 and .24 percent of growth, which is the highest on record,\" he noted, adding, \"We've added 133,000 jobs in the last three years in the oil and natural gas extraction sector, and those numbers are projected to continue to grow.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Podesta -- who is overseeing the president's climate action plan -- noted that solar and wind production had increased during President Obama's tenure. Over this period, electricity generation from solar increased by more than 10 times, and tripled from wind power, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama will be showcasing the issue of climate change this week, by unveiling a report Tuesday detailing how global warming will affect the nation in the years to come and announcing new solar power commitments by the private sector at the end of the week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We obviously need all hands on deck if we're going to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, the impacts that the IPCC warned us about just a month or so ago and that the National Climate Assessment will bring into sharp focus with respect to the U.S.,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the briefing, Podesta said he was confident that Democrats could successfully counter criticism that they're opposed to domestic oil and gas production.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People will make that argument, but I think that if you look at the overall mix, it's cleaner, it's more domestically produced,\" he said. \"We have turned the corner so that we're now producing more oil than we're importing. Those are all facts that I think that -- that can be utilized by candidates to make the case that we're on the right path to have a cleaner, better and more secure, more American-made energy future for the country.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Podesta said he was confident the White House could beat back any attempts by congressional Republicans to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's upcoming proposal to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. which will come out in early June.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"All I would say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We're committed to moving forward with those rules,\" he said. \"We're committed to maintaining the authority and the president's authority to ensure that the Clean Air Act is fully implemented. That's critical to the health of the American people, the health of the economy and the health of our environment. So they may try, but I think that there's -- there are no takers at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

It will allow Biden to beef up environmental standards at home without the risk of American businesses losing out to companies that operate in countries with laxer environmental standards, they say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Biden administration wants to have a trading system where people are not advantaged by declining to follow through on commitments they've made to any number of issues, but notably on climate change in the 2015 Paris agreement,\" said Daniel Esty, a professor at Yale Law School with expertise in environment and trade policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift under Biden could spell a major change in the country's trade approach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue could come to a head sooner than later: More than 100 lawmakers sent a letter yesterday urging Biden to add Paris commitments to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Such an action would help restore the United States' role as a leader in addressing the climate crisis and demonstrate how trade agreements can be utilized to advance climate goals,\" the members write.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who leads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, points out that a simple majority in Congress can approve new multilateral environmental agreements under the deal. Blumenauer hopes the Biden administration takes advantage ofthat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After all, although the United States routinely signs trade agreements that include environmental provisions, critics say that those commitments lack teeth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the U.S. trade record is even more sparse when it comes to climate change issues specifically. Republicans in 2016 successfully pushed for a measure to limit the fast-tracking of any deals that require domestic carbon cuts. When the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal was signed two years later under President Trump, its language made no explicit mention of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And environmentalists were part of a coalition of interest groups that helped sink the Obama administration's proposed trade agreement with other Pacific Rim countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, over concerns it made it too easy for corporations to pollute abroad.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Biden campaigned on working with U.S. allies to use trade to combat climate change \"without offering too many specifics,\" said Alexandra Stark, a senior researcher at the New America think tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s choice for chief trade negotiator will have her work cut out for her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Katherine Tai, who Biden chose to be U.S. trade representative, has a history of pushing behind the scenes for strong environmental standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tai, who serves as the chief trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee, played a central role in negotiations around revising the North American Free Trade Agreement during the Trump administration.The resulting deal was criticized on the left for leaving out any mention of climate,but activists and politicians say that was despite her efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've seen her push ardently for environmental priorities to be taken seriously and, in fact, implemented in trade agreements,\" said Ben Beachy, director of the living economy program at the Sierra Club, an environmental group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe probably will force Biden to take a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The European Union is working to put in place a carbon border tax. Under this system, countries that have not already set a carbon price of their own may find that those prices are added in when they export their goods to Europe. It's a change that could have major repercussions for American industries, and it could spur discussions in the United States about how to avoid the fees \u2014 either by putting in place a domestic carbon price or coming up with an alternative treaty arrangement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The U.S. will have to respond,\" said Maria Panezi, a professor of international trade law at the University of New Brunswick in Canada. \"Given how quickly the European Union moves on this issue, their hand will be forced.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has moved away from pushing for a carbon price, instead focusing on economic stimulus and investments in green energy. At the same time, hisenergy plancalls for imposing \"adjustment fees or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Panezi suggests that this might be a difficult needle to thread: The World Trade Organization allows countries to impose adjustment fees on imports only if they already have their own domestic restrictions. \"You have to clean up your own backyard first,\" Panezi puts it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One option for the Biden administration would be to embrace legislation sponsored by Blumenauer that would impose a carbon tax in the United States and carbon tariffs for imported goods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's going be an argument that something like 50 other countries now have pricing mechanisms as part of their climate change strategies [and] American exporters will be at risk of facing carbon charges,\" said Esty, whowas floatedas a possible contender to lead the Environmental Protection Agency last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Biden administration is confronting a trade landscape radically altered by Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's trade wars have angered allies and supercharged tensions with China, and it may be hard to roll back the clock: Reducing tariffs couldspark pushbackfrom segments of U.S. industry or engender criticism that Biden is soft on China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the Trump administration so aggressively promoted the export of fossil fuels that the United Statesbriefly overtookSaudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign,Biden was unclear about whether he supportsbanning the export of fossil fuels.The United States blocked the sales of crude oil abroad for four decades until Congress and President Barack Obama lifted the moratorium in 2015.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tai also will have to balance human rights considerations:A recent reportfound that solar companies that supply more than a third of the world's polysilicon, a key ingredient in solar panels, are tied to forced labor in China's autonomous Xinjiang region.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental advocates want to make sure new trade agreements don't accelerate the race to the bottom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past, they've seen trade agreements as a problem rather than a solution because manycompanies have used free trade pacts to move operations to the countries with laxer pollution rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"These corporations then make steel, auto parts and other products with a high degree of climate pollution and send them back to the U.S. for our consumption,\" said Beachy of the Sierra Club. \"As a result, the amount of carbon that goes into the goods we import is so large that it equals the total carbon emissions of all U.S. factories combined.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As eager as allies may be for renegotiated deals with the new administration, they may have to wait.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has said that he intends to hold off on any new agreements until he has tackled top domestic priorities on the economy and coronavirus response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Biden is wasting no time fulfilling his campaign promise of nixing the Keystone XL pipeline, which is expected to be one of his first actions in office. Blocking the proposed oil conduit, meant to bring crude from Alberta to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, may end up being a point of contention between Biden and the leader to the north, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who supports the pipeline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Power playsBiden\u2019s Day 1 executive orders are set to overturn Trump\u2019s climate legacy on dozens of fronts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president-elect \"intends to sign more than a dozen executive orders and direct nearly 100 agency actions aimed at unraveling Donald Trump's environmental policies\" within hours of taking office Wednesday, our colleagues Steven Mufson, Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to a long-expected return to the Paris climate accord, Biden will sign \"a broad executive order\" to federal agencies to reassess scores of Trump-era environmental policies.

These are very real risks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yellen's commitments mark a victory for lawmakers and advocates who want the Biden administration to enlist Treasury's sweeping influence to address the dangers that climate change poses to the economy,\" Politico writes.

In some parts of the world, that is exactly what happened last year, climate scientists reported Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures add energy to the atmosphere, and computer models warn that this will produce wider and wilder swings in temperature and rainfall and alter prevailing wind patterns. In examining a dozen extreme weather events last year, scientists found that evidence that human activity \u2014 in particular, emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 was a partial culprit in about half of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet other extreme weather events, including the drought that withered the Midwest, appear to be just part of a natural pattern, the scientists concluded. The research, a series of 19 studies by 18 teams, was published in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While global warming will likely increase the number and severity of extreme weather events, climate scientists have been reluctant to attribute a particular heat wave, storm or drought directly to global warming, because of the natural variations of weather. But with advances in computer modeling and analysis of climate data, they are now able to tease out the contributions of human civilization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The extreme weather events \u201cwould have likely occurred regardless of climate change,\u201d said Thomas R. Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe importance of attribution research comes with understanding, however, the impact that climate change adds, or doesn\u2019t add, to any extreme event,\u201d he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The articles\u2019 editors likened climate change to someone habitually driving a bit over the speed limit. Even if the speeding itself is unlikely to directly cause an accident, it increases the likelihood that something else \u2014 a wet road or a distracting text message \u2014 will do so and that the accident, when it occurs, will be more calamitous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even when global warming contributes to extreme weather, \u201cnatural variability can still be the primary factor in any individual extreme event,\u201d the editors wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To examine causes of the Midwest drought last year, the most severe since the 1950s, researchers ran computer models comparing two situations: one with present-day concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the other with the much lower greenhouse gas concentrations before the Industrial Revolution. They found little difference in the frequency of Midwest droughts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But scientists performing a similar comparison for the heat wave that blanketed much of the United States in July last year estimated that such heat waves now occur four times as frequently because of the influence of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was really clear and it was really stark,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Peterson, principal scientist at the climate center. \u201cThings had changed dramatically.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another team, reviewing data on a heat wave in the eastern United States in the spring of last year, estimated that the activities of humans contributed about one-third of the 6.6-degree spike in temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis of Hurricane Sandy did not look at the dynamics of the storm, but rather how often floodwaters have reached the heights seen last October. Because sea levels have been rising, the chances of Sandy-like flooding inundating the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan have risen from once every 2,330 years in 1950 to once every 1,570 years today, the researchers said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If sea level rise over the next 40 years is low, about half a foot, then the chances of flooding increase slightly. If sea level rise is at the top end up of predictions \u2014 two yards \u2014 then much smaller storms would cause as much flooding as Sandy did and Lower Manhattan could be inundated every couple of years by 2100, the researchers said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cCoastal communities are facing a looming crisis due to climate-related sea level rise,\u201d said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and one of the authors of the Sandy study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Record-low ice cover in the Arctic in 2012 was partially caused by global warming, researchers also said. But heavy rains in northern Europe, China and Japan were all explainable by natural variability.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The island was declared effectively uninhabitable, water service was severed, and power is not expected back until month's end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate Point: Subscribe to USA TODAY's weekly newsletter on climate, energy and the environment</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With insurance and FEMA assistance, Melancon, 63, is already making plans to repair his oyster-sorting shed, to clean his yard of debris, and to replace the lawnmower swamped by Hurricane Ida's storm surge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while Melancon suffered relatively little damage this time, things could have been much worse, not just for him but for all of the approximately 1,500 people who call this island home, and for the tens of thousands more who vacation here each summer. Experts say Grand Isle is a harbinger for things to come: rising sea levels, stronger storms and more destruction for coastal areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With sea levels rising an average of 3.6 millimeters annually due to climate change, Louisiana's coast is simultaneously sinking, possibly in connection with the vast amounts of oil, natural gas and water that have been extracted over the past decades to fuel and power the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means places like Grand Isle, reached by a long causeway from mainland Louisiana, is demonstrating today what other coastal areas will see in the coming years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it raises questions about how long governments will try to protect property and how much tax money they're willing to spend rebuild roads and power lines and homes before ceding it to the sea. In 2014, federal scientists said Grand Isle sank 1.3 inches in five years, one of the largest drops globally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Louisiana coast is in general a canary in the coal mine,\" said Samuel Bentley, a Louisiana State University expert on coastal erosion. \"We are experiencing conditions now that other areas will face in the future. From the perspective of a homeowners or a city official, it doesn't matter if it's subsidence or sea level rise. It becomes a political decision at some point.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The history of 'hauntingly beautiful' Grand Isle, Louisiana</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Federal, state and local officials have long known the danger faced by Grand Isle, which under normal circumstances is a bucolic, sandy island with shave ice shops, fishing rodeos and beach bar after beach bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, the New York Times declared the island one of its top places to visit for 2020, ranking it with Greenland, Tokyo and the British Virgin Islands. But the reporter also asked, \"Does a place appear more hauntingly beautiful when you know it\u2019s disappearing?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First used by indigenous, nomadic natives, the Grand Isle and nearby Cheni\u00e8re Caminada and Leeville areas grew in the early 1800s as the French, Spanish and growing United States colonized Louisiana. Pirate and privateer Jean Lafitte frequented the area, and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War occupied an unfinished fort on adjacent Grand Terre Island, fleeing after the United States retook New Orleans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the enslavement of people was banned following the Civil War, plantations on Grand Isle were replaced by vacation resorts for the wealthy. They were themselves destroyed and then rebuilt following the 1893 Cheni\u00e8re Caminada hurricane, which sent a wall of water 16 feet high across the area, killing about half of the residents of the nearby farming community and erasing the fields that once grew produce for New Orleans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been trying to repair and protect the island since 1976, and in some areas installed a giant sand-filled tube known as \"the burrito\" running parallel to the ocean's waves at the highest point on the beach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'It ain't easy right now': Hurricane Ida strands residents, wipes away landmarks on Louisiana island</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those efforts have been repeatedly set back by hurricanes: 2005's Katrina damaged the repairs, which were almost fixed by the time Gustav arrived in 2008, destroying some of the repairs to the repairs. Subsequent hurricanes damaged subsequent repairs, and last summer, state taxpayers spent $7.5 million repairing levee breaches and building a new 1\u00bc-mile-long beach, which immediately became a popular gathering spot, drawing more people to the island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was a great summer, the island was booming. You could feel everyone doing good,\" said seventh-generation Grand Isle resident Holden Landry, 25.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Landry's family has owned one of the island's grocery stores, Sureway Supermarket since his grandfather founded it in 1976. His grandfather, Landry said, never saw storms like Ida.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My mom had two of these storms. And my sister and I had our first one at 25 and 27,\" Landry said. \"We all have a business plan down here, but God kinda scribbled over our plans.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ida knocked out power to the Landry's store, spoiling all the refrigerated and frozen food. As the island struggled without electricity 10 days later, Landry sat outside the store in a golf cart, escorting in what few customers came so they could buy essentials, from coffee to gas cans needed to keep generators running.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Landry, who left the island to attend college on the mainland, returned after graduation to help run the store, and now has a two-month-old son, the eighth generation to be raised here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cEach storm that hits, people go away. There\u2019s elderly locals who just don\u2019t come back,\" he said. \u201cThe easiest thing you could do is move away. But I want to stick it out. There\u2019s a lot of pride in being down here. If you have to start over, might as well start over in a place you have pride.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate could make hurricanes like 'freakish' Ida more common</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few doors down, Chris Collins took stock of his family's gas station and convenience store, Jo-Bob\u2019s. Like Sureway, the store wasn't officially open, but Collins and his mom were around to sell gas for generators, taking cash from people who had it, and giving IOUs to the others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019m grateful and humbled in ways I\u2019ve never been before,\" said Collins, who rode out the storm. \"That was a freakish storm. The worst case scenario? We just saw it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts predict storms like Ida will become more common as ocean waters warm, providing more heat energy to spin up hurricanes. Ida wasn't actually a worst-case scenario, they point out, because it intensified so rapidly that it never had time to generate a truly large surge like the 16-foot-high one from the 1893 Cheni\u00e8re Caminada hurricane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the howling winds ripped apart buildings, snapped power poles and drove stormwater nearly across the island. The three-foot-surge that hit the causeway serving Grand Isle peeled up portions of the road like flaking paint, narrowing the road to one lane in many areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Collins, 44, lived in New York City for many years, returning recently to help his parents run the store. He said he was shocked on his return to see how many more camps had been built in areas longtime locals would never have chosen, and the erosion of protective marshland caused by ships serving the offshore oil platforms blinking in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said he believes the loss of the island is ultimately inevitable \u2013 but struggles with how to adapt. Do they try selling to someone else? Wait for a government buyout? Just keep rebuilding their canopy and roof?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cRunning is not an option for me now,\" he said after a pause. \"The island still has its magic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back at his home, Melancon is picking through the debris, watching for roofing nails scattered in the grass, and wondering when the electricity and water will come back on. The seas have finally calmed, and he's anxious to get out to his oyster beds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His grandfather used to harvest oysters around Independence Island, but that has vanished beneath the waves, and Melancon now farms his oysters in several bays around Grand Isle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cGod took care of me,\" he said. \u201cI just want to get back to work.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The uncertain future of Grand Isle: 'Barrier islands are not forever'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conversations people on Grand Isle need to have are the same kinds of conversations coastal residents around the world need to be having, said Mark Davis, 67, the professor who directs the Tulane Center for Environmental Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Communities have to have a real conversation about the choices. Because otherwise at some point, decisions will be made for it,\" Davis said. \"The kind of issues that Grand Isle presents will replay in Miami Beach, in Norfolk, Virginia. We are going to face these questions and our options for each are different. But not one of them is ensured a future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WATCH: Louisiana slowly reopening after Hurricane Ida</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recovering from disaster: Hurricane Ida will be 'devastating' to tourism industry</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis said the physics of what's happening to Grand Isle are not up for debate, regardless of climate change \u2013 sandy barrier islands wash away while bearing the brunt of whatever storms hit them. Climate change, he said, is accelerating a geological process that's been well underway for centuries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Barrier islands are not forever. And sea levels are not forever. And right now they are shifting and changes at rates we have no experience with,\" he said. \"Grand Isle is in transition. The question is, transition to what?

Cycles of drought and deluge have always tested the limits of our water infrastructure's ability to keep agricultural and metropolitan areas habitable and productive (even as the sources of that water face ecological devastation), but climate change threatens more fires, more dry spells and higher temperatures.

Muller|Professor of Physics|University of California, Berkeley|Five scientific papers published on BerkeleyEarth.org|Academic|Muller discusses his change in perspective on global warming and the scientific methods used in his research.</p><p>N/A|N/A|Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project|N/A|Academic/Nonprofit|The project provides evidence and methodology related to earth's land temperature increase and its attribution to human activity.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Berkeley, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CALL me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I\u2019m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of the earth\u2019s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These findings are stronger than those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on global warming. In its 2007 report, the I.P.C.C. concluded only that most of the warming of the prior 50 years could be attributed to humans. It was possible, according to the I.P.C.C. consensus statement, that the warming before 1956 could be because of changes in solar activity, and that even a substantial part of the more recent warming could be natural.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our Berkeley Earth approach used sophisticated statistical methods developed largely by our lead scientist, Robert Rohde, which allowed us to determine earth land temperature much further back in time. We carefully studied issues raised by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations and poor ones) and from human intervention and data adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off). In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The historic temperature pattern we observed has abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect sunlight, make for beautiful sunsets and cool the earth\u2019s surface for a few years. There are small, rapid variations attributable to El Ni\u00f1o and other ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream; because of such oscillations, the \u201cflattening\u201d of the recent temperature rise that some people claim is not, in our view, statistically significant. What has caused the gradual but systematic rise of two and a half degrees? We tried fitting the shape to simple math functions (exponentials, polynomials), to solar activity and even to rising functions like world population. By far the best match was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as important, our record is long enough that we could search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent. Although the I.P.C.C. allowed for the possibility that variations in sunlight could have ended the \u201cLittle Ice Age,\u201d a period of cooling from the 14th century to about 1850, our data argues strongly that the temperature rise of the past 250 years cannot be attributed to solar changes. This conclusion is, in retrospect, not too surprising; we\u2019ve learned from satellite measurements that solar activity changes the brightness of the sun very little.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we\u2019ve tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect \u2014 extra warming from trapped heat radiation. These facts don\u2019t prove causality and they shouldn\u2019t end skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at least as well as carbon dioxide does. Adding methane, a second greenhouse gas, to our analysis doesn\u2019t change the results. Moreover, our analysis does not depend on large, complex global climate models, the huge computer programs that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s a scientist\u2019s duty to be properly skeptical. I still find that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I\u2019ve analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Katrina cannot be attributed to global warming. The number of hurricanes hitting the United States has been going down, not up; likewise for intense tornadoes. Polar bears aren\u2019t dying from receding ice, and the Himalayan glaciers aren\u2019t going to melt by 2035. And it\u2019s possible that we are currently no warmer than we were a thousand years ago, during the \u201cMedieval Warm Period\u201d or \u201cMedieval Optimum,\u201d an interval of warm conditions known from historical records and indirect evidence like tree rings. And the recent warm spell in the United States happens to be more than offset by cooling elsewhere in the world, so its link to \u201cglobal\u201d warming is weaker than tenuous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The careful analysis by our team is laid out in five scientific papers now online at BerkeleyEarth.org. That site also shows our chart of temperature from 1753 to the present, with its clear fingerprint of volcanoes and carbon dioxide, but containing no component that matches solar activity. Four of our papers have undergone extensive scrutiny by the scientific community, and the newest, a paper with the analysis of the human component, is now posted, along with the data and computer programs used. Such transparency is the heart of the scientific method; if you find our conclusions implausible, tell us of any errors of data or analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if the oceans are included. But if China continues its rapid economic growth (it has averaged 10 percent per year over the last 20 years) and its vast use of coal (it typically adds one new gigawatt per month), then that same warming could take place in less than 20 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in principle, is universally accepted.

If anything, the Earth is getting hotter faster than expected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Droughts, wildfires, floods</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, the world's tentative embrace of wind and solar renewable energy has bent the arc of a sizzling planet from apocalyptic by century's end (a 4 degrees Celsius increase over pre-industrial levels, or 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to merely catastrophic (3 degrees Celsius by 2100).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And promises on paper by nations to further cut emissions, if actually kept, could reduce temperature increases to maybe 2 to 2.4 Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even that would be terrifying. Disasters the planet already is experiencing in the form of droughts, wildfires, floods and intense storms would become more common and even more intense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One in 3 people would suffer severe heat rather than, as today, 1 in 7. Fresh water would grow more scarce, crop yields more meager and ocean ecosystems more distraught with the loss of coral reefs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the Paris accords urged every effort be taken to hold rising temperature from the pre-industrial era to 1.5 Celsius. It already has risen 1.1 degrees. Any hope of holding it to a 1.5-degree increase or even an unhealthy 2 degrees requires cutting fossil fuel emissions worldwide to net zero by 2050, and that means dramatic action this decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is an extraordinarily heavy lift given the fossil fuel dependency of such countries as China (30% of the world's emissions), the United States (15%), Europe (9%), India (7%) and Russia (5%) \u2013 and the barely addressed needs of less developed countries that must decarbonize and adapt to a warming climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists have made the math very easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a Reuters analysis of the findings, Earth can absorb only an additional 500 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions without warming beyond 1.5 Celsius. The nations of the world, led by China and America, now emit 50 billion tons per year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glasgow summit was important</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It feels insurmountable, and that's why the climate summit in Glasgow, hosted by the United Nations and the United Kingdom, was closely watched.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Joe Biden, to his credit, has reversed the reckless apathy of the Trump administration and pledged to cut U.S. emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, with dramatic plans to transform reliance on fossil fuels in generating power and fueling vehicles. He'll preach this in Scotland, but with the sad reality that Congress is struggling to approve his plans to reach those goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Promises by the other key polluters is a mixed bag as the conference begins:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe is pledging a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China, whose President Xi Jinping did not attend the climate summit, is talking about only beginning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>India shunned a net-zero promise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Russia is aiming to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and rely on its vast forests to do the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world's citizens have already have seen and felt too much of climate change to tolerate further platitudes or empty promises.

It says the agency will issue a formal notice of its intention to develop a new rule \u201csimilarly intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric utility generating units and to solicit information for the agency to consider in developing such a rule.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The document does not explain how the E.P.A. will justify to the courts the decision to eliminate the regulation. Several industry attorneys familiar with the agency\u2019s plans said they expected Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, to argue that the Obama administration relied on an overly broad reading of federal clean air laws in writing the Clean Power Plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump has vowed since the campaign to \u201cget rid\u201d of the Obama-era environmental regulations. He has called the Clean Power Plan \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cjob killing,\u201d and in an executive order issued in March he directed Mr. Pruitt to dismantle the rules. Last month, Mr. Trump appeared to claim he had already done so, telling a crowd in Alabama: \u201cDid you see what I did to that? Boom, gone.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Killing the regulation has also been a high priority for Mr. Pruitt, who as attorney general of Oklahoma sued to overturn it in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in recent weeks, industry groups have pressed the Trump administration to fashion a new, narrower measure in its stead. Many have argued that creating such a replacement, rather than simply repealing the Clean Power Plan, is necessary to avoid lawsuits. Under a landmark agency determination known as the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. is required to regulate carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Pruitt has been under pressure from interest groups that deny the scientific consensus on climate change \u2014 that it is occurring and caused by human emissions \u2014 to overturn that determination. The E.P.A. document does not indicate Mr. Pruitt\u2019s plans, but creating a new regulation implicitly accepts that the federal government has a role in addressing the reduction of carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It remains unclear when the agency will formally repeal the rule. Liz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the document or plans for the rule.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clean Power Plan, which required states to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent by 2030 relative to 2005 has been tied up in litigation. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had set an Oct. 7 deadline for the E.P.A. to show progress in its decision making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brian Deese, who served as a senior adviser on climate change to Mr. Obama, said the E.P.A. was buying time. Asking the public for ideas, he said, is what an agency does when it is uncertain about how to proceed. Consideration of a new regulation could take months or even years, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to walk this tightrope,\u201d Mr. Deese said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow @NYTClimate on Twitter</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/climate/trump-climate-change.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: LISA FRIEDMAN\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Last week, President Biden signed an executive order promising that by 2030, half of all new vehicles sold in the United States will be electric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a transformative change for a nation in no small way defined by its love of the internal combustion engine. But on the heels of the latest dire United Nations climate change report \u2014 which the U.N. Secretary General said \u201cmust sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet\u201d \u2014 does Biden\u2019s plan go far enough? And can the climate problem posed by America\u2019s car dependency really be solved by swapping gasoline for batteries? Here\u2019s what people are saying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Goodbye to gasoline</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gas-powered vehicles are the biggest single source of greenhouse gases in the United States, accounting for more than a quarter of the country\u2019s total emissions. \u201cA rapid shift from fossil-fueled combustion engines to electric vehicles is an essential step toward mitigating climate change,\u201d The Times\u2019s Coral Davenport says. \u201cYou can\u2019t solve climate change without getting rid of them.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In line with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, President Biden has promised to put the country on a path to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Because vehicles stay on the road for many years, though, it\u2019s estimated that all new cars would have to be electric by 2035 to reach that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s feasible, technologically, to replace most cars already on the road with equally affordable and powerful electric models within the next decade,\u201d Davenport says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where things stand: In the United States, E.V.s remain something of a rarity: Just 2 percent of new cars sold are electric or plug-in hybrid, a far lower rate than in China and Europe, in large part because those places have more generous financial incentives and stricter auto regulations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But underneath the surface, the market is unmistakably moving in the electric direction. This year, General Motors announced that it would phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Jaguar and Daimler, the world\u2019s largest maker of heavy trucks, soon followed. And in May, Ford introduced an electric version of its F-150 pickup truck, the best-selling vehicle in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transition could happen more quickly than some think. Justin Rowlatt, the BBC\u2019s chief environmental correspondent, believes the E.V. market right now is about where the internet was around the late 1990s or early 2000s. \u201cThe internet, like all successful new technologies, did not follow a linear path to world domination,\u201d he wrote in June. \u201cIts growth was explosive and disruptive, crushing existing businesses and changing the way we do almost everything.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are E.V.s really a silver bullet for America\u2019s car problem?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you were trying to create a sustainable society from scratch, blanketing the country with highways and hundreds of millions of individually powered vehicles that sit idle 95 percent of the time is not how you\u2019d do it. Cars \u2014 whatever their fuel source \u2014 are one of the least energy-efficient modes we have of getting from point A to point B. Some argue that climate change should spur the country to rethink the car\u2019s centrality in American life, rather than just to replace one version of it with another.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe planet will be much better off if we switch to electric cars,\u201d the Times columnist Farhad Manjoo writes. \u201cBut gauzy visions of the guilt-free highways of tomorrow could easily distract us from the larger and more entrenched problem with America\u2019s transportation system. That problem isn\u2019t just gas-fueled cars but car-fueled lives \u2014 a view of the world in which huge private automobiles are the default method of getting around.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Transitioning to E.V.s is seen by many as a more realistic path to net-zero emissions than breaking up America\u2019s love affair with cars, as Manjoo calls for. But just how realistic is it? Biden\u2019s executive order has no binding authority, and he has resisted calls to set a mandatory timeline for phasing out combustion engines, as the European Union has proposed and as California and Massachusetts have committed to doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the Biden administration plans to impose a set of emissions regulations it hopes will compel automakers to phase out gas-powered cars. But under the administration\u2019s current plan, those regulations \u2014 which officials say will be legally challenging to write \u2014 won\u2019t take effect until 2026. In the meantime, the administration plans only to restore emissions standards to about the levels that existed under President Barack Obama but were weakened during the Trump administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That timeline has drawn criticism from some analysts and activists. \u201cVoluntary pledges from auto companies make a New Year\u2019s resolution to lose weight look like a legally binding contract,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign. \u201cGlobal warming is burning forests, roasting the West and worsening storms. Now is not the time to propose weak standards and promise strong ones later.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the near term, the E.V. transition will depend on whether Americans are willing to make the switch. \u201cPossibly the biggest hurdle ahead is consumer acceptance,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto-data firm Edmunds, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWhat will it take for Americans to be willing to change their car ownership habits to go electric?\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One major obstacle to widespread adoption is anxiety over running out of power, as charging stations are still much sparser than gas ones. Another obstacle is expense: While E.V.s are cheaper for consumers in the long run, they can cost up to $10,000 more than their gas-powered counterparts upfront.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate passed this week would authorize only $7.5 billion to build charging stations across the country, half of Biden\u2019s original request, and it does not expand incentives for E.V. purchases. Automakers have said widespread adoption cannot happen without such investments. Democrats are aiming to incorporate more E.V.-related spending into their reconciliation bill, but its future remains uncertain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government could also spur adoption by raising the tax on gasoline, as the editorial boards of The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times have urged, but the Biden administration has called the idea \u201ca nonstarter.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without these big carrots and sticks, the E.V. transition could extend well beyond 2050. \u201cIf automakers phased out sales of new internal combustion engines, it\u2019s possible that older gasoline-powered cars might persist for even longer on the roads, as consumers who are unable to afford newer, pricier electric cars instead turn to cheaper used models and drive them more,\u201d The Times\u2019s Ivan Penn and Niraj Chokshi write.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that reason, some analysts argue that America\u2019s car fleet will have to shrink as it electrifies. \u201cIf electric vehicles are to play a major role in solving the climate crisis \u2014 which they must \u2014 they have to be paired with dramatic land use reform that shortens or eliminates a substantial portion of all vehicle trips, and replaces them with transit, walking, biking, shared vehicles, and other forms of mobility,\u201d writes Matthew Lewis, the director of communications at California YIMBY.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the car is still king</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it was difficult to imagine a sweeping overhaul of public transportation in the United States before the pandemic \u2014 in 2019, just 5 percent of American commuters used public transit to get to work \u2014 it\u2019s even more difficult now. The coronavirus pushed ridership and revenue off a cliff last year, and they still haven\u2019t recovered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decline was a global phenomenon, prompting a rapid investment in cycling infrastructure in some countries. But in the United States, the coronavirus has for the most part only strengthened the bond between Americans and their automobiles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf commuters shun public transit for cars as their cities recover from the pandemic, that has huge implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d The Times reported in March. \u201cMost importantly, if transit systems continue to lose passenger fare revenues, they will not be able to make the investments necessary to be efficient, safe and attractive to commuters.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate infrastructure bill allocates about three times the amount of money for highways as it does for public transit. To some, like The Urban Institute\u2019s Yonah Freemark, that\u2019s a big missed opportunity. \u201cThe bill does not seem likely to produce the conditions for a movement of Americans away from driving and toward other modes like transit, walking, and biking,\u201d he told The Verge. \u201cThe bill provides next to nothing for non-motorized modes of transportation.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E.V.s may not be the ideal climate solution, but they\u2019re the one Americans have to work with for now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do you have a point of view we missed?

He touted the U.S. global response, which includes an investment of more than $15 billion, as a \"dose of hope\" and said he would announce additional commitments at a virtual COVID-19 summit Wednesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our security, our prosperity and our very freedoms are interconnected as never before. And so, I believe, we must work together as never before,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He reiterated that climate change is a \"code red for humanity,\" anticipating the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, next month. Biden announced he would work with Congress to double his commitment of $5.7 billion per year to help developing countries cope with the effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'Back at the table'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden, who's faced questions over U.S. credibility in the wake of the American military's withdrawal from Afghanistan, emphasized his administration's commitment to rebuilding alliances, including by reassuring NATO and European leaders and rejoining multilateral agreements that his predecessor, Donald Trump, left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and spur global action and shared challenges,\" Biden said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also used the diplomatic speech to underscored that the United States is \"not seeking a new Cold War,\" a message directly aimed at China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,\" he said in a message probably aimed at China, though he didn't explicitly mention Beijing. \"All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships, so they do not tip from responsible competition into conflict.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shadow of COVID-19 looms large over the annual summit, which took place virtually last year. But the event also comes as the Biden administration also struggles to contain the fallout from a series of diplomatic blunders, including a chaotic and deadly evacuation in Afghanistan after the Taliban swept to power last month. The Pentagon acknowledged Friday that 10 civilians, including an aid worker and as many as seven children, were killed in a drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, in the final days of the 20-year war.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>France recalled its ambassador to the United States and Australia after it was rattled by a new partnership between the two countries and the U.K. that rendered a French submarine contract obsolete.

Jesse Helms, U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to hammer out an agreement for the United States to pay its dues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As vice president, Biden frequently met with foreign leaders at the annual summit and engaged in what Lyon described as \"cocktail napkin diplomacy\" on the sidelines of the General Assembly. He sat in for President Barack Obama in a number of sessions, including one on combating the Islamic State terrorist group in 2015, and co-chaired a U.N. peacekeeping summit in 2014.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Biden himself is prone to cooperation and collaboration and values that work historically,\" Lyon said. \"So a lot of us are puzzled that the Biden administration seems to contradict their own narrative, their own story about cooperation as being important and essential and yet not working multilaterally.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president took office with years of foreign policy experience and global standing that provided a familiar balm to those alarmed by the four years of Trump's \"America first\" isolationist foreign policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the early months, Biden tried to reassure allies by reversing some of his predecessor's policies, including recommitting to the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and launching negotiations about rejoining the nuclear deal with Iran. In his first foreign trip abroad, Biden sought to rebuild international relations at the G-7 summit in Cornwall, followed by a meeting with NATO leaders at the headquarters in Brussels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Trump is gone\u2019 but lingering: As Biden vows \u2018America is back,\u2019 allies wonder for how long</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The goodwill generated by his election, as well as by his initial statements about America's renewed international engagement, has all been evaporated,\" said Brett Bruen, a former foreign service officer who worked on global engagement in the Obama administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president acknowledged that \"no democracy is perfect, including the United States,\" but he said the country would \"continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diplomatic rough patch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House bristled at criticism that Biden will have to rebuild U.S. credibility in New York this week. A senior administration official insisted before the U.N. speech that the \"picture is actually quite positive\" despite the American exit from Afghanistan and the diplomatic spat with Paris.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's important to note that criticism of a decision is different from criticism of the credibility and leadership of the United States,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday before Biden's speech. \"And if you look back through the course of the last several decades prior to the last administration, there are points of disagreement, including when we have disagreed with the decisions other countries are making, when countries have disagreed with the decisions we're making.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Biden may aspire to be a transformative president abroad to course-correct his predecessor's policies, no single foreign policy issue is more critical than the crises he faces at home, according to Miller.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aides have repeatedly said the president's focus is ending the pandemic and reviving the U.S. economy, but Biden's legacy will also be shaped by whether Congress will pass his infrastructure plan and a spending package that would expand the social safety net \u2013 two bills that Democrats vowed to bring to a vote by the end of the month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He understands that his bandwidth for pursuing grandiose foreign policy and transformative adventures abroad is very limited because governance is about choosing,\" Miller said. \"He understands that the choices are much more consequential at home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lyon said Biden's recent foreign policy moves underscore the president's long-term strategic plan to counter the rise of China as a global power. The hasty Afghanistan exit was about consolidating resources and cutting ties to foreign wars, she said, and the Australian submarine contract is more about Beijing than a slight to the French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That contradicts what Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman envisioned in the creation of the United Nations after World War II, according to Lyon. She said they thought the best way to counter global threats would be to work together through a global institution devoted to peace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's an explanation (for Biden's actions), but it's not one that supports the agenda of the United Nations,\" Lyon said. \"We're working on our second administration that the Americans generally aren't necessarily committed to working with us, and that's what Biden has to overcome.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contributing: Michael Collins</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden to UN: US is shifting from 'relentless war' to relentless diplomacy' amid COVID-19, climate change crises\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

They'll get wealthier, for one. Many of them will add millions more people. And some, like New Orleans, will continue sinking into the ground, thanks to things like erosion or groundwater pumping.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On top of all that, there's sea-level rise to consider. As the world gets warmer, climate scientists expect the oceans to rise somewhere around one foot by 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tally it all up, and flooding is going to become a bigger, more expensive problem for the world's coastal cities. How much bigger? A new study in Nature Climate Change estimates that average annual losses from flooding in the world's biggest coastal cities could rise from about $6 billion per year today to $1 trillion per year by 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's only if cities took no preventative action at all. By contrast, if coastal cities worked to bolster their defenses -- from levees to pumps to movable barriers -- and improved flood monitoring, then the average annual losses go down to $63 billion per year. That's still a big increase, but it's not nearly as steep. (That said, the authors estimate those defenses could cost around $50 billion per year between now and 2050.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tim McDonnell of Climate Desk has put together a helpful map from the data in the study showing the 20 cities facing the highest annual average flooding costs by mid-century. This study builds on previous estimates by taking coastal defenses into account:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States is well-represented here, not least because its cities are so wealthy and have a lot of stuff to damage: New York City faces about $2 billion in annual losses from flooding in 2050, Miami faces $2.5 billion per year, and New Orleans faces $1.8 billion per year. Boston and Tampa Bay are also looking at considerable expenses. Again, this is all assuming these cities improve their flood defenses to maintain \"relative risk levels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, notice that the city facing the highest absolute costs, by far, is Guangzhou -- and that 5 of the 20 cities facing the steepest flooding costs are located in China. Studies like these may help explain why the Chinese government has placed an increased focus on climate change in recent years.*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's worth noting, however, that climate change is only part of the reason for the increase in flooding risks. The authors estimate that average flood damage would increase to about $52 billion annually even if climate change wasn't a factor at all -- just based on population and economic growth. (As more and more Americans move to the coast, the cost of flooding goes up.) Rising sea levels then add another $11 billion per year on top of that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even that could be a low-end estimate, though: This study is factoring in relatively mild sea-level rise scenarios of just 7.9 inches by mid-century. If the seas rise more, the costs go up. And then there are the years after 2050 to consider. A recent leaked draft of the forthcoming IPCC report suggested that sea levels could rise more than three feet by the end of the century if emissions continue unchecked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also worth taking a look at the map of cities that will see the biggest relative increase in average annual losses between now and 2050 (these aren't absolute costs, but they'll see the biggest change). Many of these cities, like Houston and Istanbul and Athens and Alexandria, don't usually feature prominently in sea-level-rise conversations:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Note that the map above is assuming a relatively mild sea-level rise (7.9 inches by mid-century) and a steady investment in flood-control technology.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Note: Another option is to look at which cities are expected to face the most damage as a percentage of their overall GDP.

Heat days are defined by a combination of factors including temperature, humidity and cloud cover.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a lot of information about how California broadly has been affected by heat -- we know that heat is increasing and that we're developing a greater and greater number of heat days as climate change gets worse and worse,\" said David Eisenman, co-director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters. \"But the difference really comes down at the neighborhood level.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The parts of L.A. County that show higher rates of ER visits during heat days include the South L.A. corridor down to the ports, the San Pedro area, and the northwest Valley, especially San Fernando and Pacoima, said Eisenman, also a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The findings mirror those outlined in the county's first-ever Climate Vulnerability Assessment, released last fall, which found that social and economic inequality is leaving millions at a disadvantage as the climate crisis worsens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to that report, extreme heat will increase in frequency, severity and duration -- including a potential tenfold increase in the occurrence of heat waves by mid-century. The largest increases will occur in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys, the report says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eisenman said the mapping tool is still in beta testing mode, but the researchers decided to release it this week because California is heading into the hottest and most dangerous time of year. In June last year, a devastating heat wave in the Pacific Northwest was linked to the deaths of at least 1,400 people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although extreme heat has become the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States, a Times investigation found that such deaths are chronically undercounted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a silent killer,\" Eisenman said, noting that unlike disasters such as tornadoes or hurricanes in which the destruction is visible, \"the pictures from before and after a heat wave look exactly the same, so we haven't really gotten the message out that heat is happening.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than 12 million Americans were under excessive heat warnings on Monday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What's more, the agency's most recent seasonal outlook shows a higher likelihood of above-normal temperatures across the western U.S. until at least September.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eisenman said the findings in L.A. County are in some ways not surprising in that they echo the \"decades of redlining\" that have led to differences in shade, access to air conditioning and even base-line health levels in some L.A. communities. Redlining was the institutional practice of denying homeownership and financial services to residents based on race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also noted that many people who visit the ER on heat days aren't there specifically for heat-related illness, but because the heat has exacerbated other underlying health issues such as diabetes, kidney dysfunction and heart disease.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marta Segura, the city of L.A.'s newly appointed \"chief heat officer,\" said in a statement that the heat risk map will help planners \"target resources to the most vulnerable areas exposed to extreme heat and thus prioritize the mitigation and adaptation measures where they are most needed.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among her office's goals are the creation of an early warning system for heat waves, and the development of long-term strategies to reduce heat exposure, such as planting trees and updating building codes, she told The Times last month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The map also shows some surprising variations across the state, with the highest rate of excess daily ER visits from extreme heat in the northwestern counties of Del Norte, Humboldt and Trinity. The California counties with the lowest rate of ER visits are Monterey, Kings and Alpine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eisenman said the reasons for this could be myriad, including that the residents and infrastructure in those northern counties may be less prepared for heat days. There may be fewer houses with air conditioning and also higher numbers of outdoor workers in rural areas, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, the rate of ER visits is only one metric of extreme heat. The counties with the highest number of ER visits during extreme heat days were Los Angeles, San Diego and Alameda, according to the map.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sheer volume of heat-related ER visits in those counties can also help direct the response, Eisenman said, particularly when it comes to staffing and equipment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our hope is that communities will take this information and call their assemblyman and their city agencies and say: 'What are we doing about this right now?' \" he said. \"Because heat is harming us right now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: EMMA AGUILAR leaps into the swimming lake at the Hansen Dam Aquatic Center on Monday.

That's because Wyoming has 61 electric charging stations and 330 registered electric vehicles in the state, the study said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Rhode Island has a ratio of 6.24 electric cars to a single charging station.

The remaining five states in the least accessible top 10 include Illinois, Oregon, Florida, Texas and Nevada.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One interesting take is California: the most populous state in the U.S. with nearly 40 million residents, the Golden State has a ratio of 31.20 electric cars to 1 charging station, said the Forbes Advisor study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While California ranks as the fourth least accessible state to charge an EV on the Forbes Advisor list, it ranked as the best state to own an electric vehicle, according to a recent study by SmartAsset.com, a personal finance site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state was the birthplace of popular EV maker Tesla, before its controversial owner Elon Musk pulled up stakes and headed to Austin, Texas, for Tesla's headquarters. Still, California has the most electric vehicles in the U.S., cars which save drivers more than $2,100 in estimated annual fuel savings, the SmartAsset study said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are electric vehicles becoming more mainstream?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, but slowly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Registrations for new EVs soared 60% in the first three months of this year, even though new car registrations slid 18% overall, Automotive News and Car and Driver reported, citing Experian data.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EVs now account for 4.6% of all passenger vehicles being sold in the U.S.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tesla vehicles had the newest EV registrations with 113,882, representing nearly 60% of electric cars registered during that period.

The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has yet to produce a broad, binding, global warming accord that many scientists say would be needed to limit the world's growing carbon output.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other G-20 leaders also endorsed the approach Friday in a joint statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, a Washington-based nonprofit group, called HFCs \"the biggest climate prize available to the world in the next few years.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an e-mail, Zaelke estimated that the accord could cut the equivalent of 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050 and would avoid up to nearly 1 degree in global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This high-level agreement during the G-20 in St. Petersburg shows how effective climate policy can be when it's done at the leader level,\" he wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new effort builds on the accord Obama and Xi struck in June, when they said for the first time that they would work together to persuade other countries to cut HFCs.

Sooty shirts and socks are a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as with even the most modern coal plants, its smokestacks still emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the invisible heat-trapping gas that is the main contributor to global warming. So this fall, a gleaming new maze of pipes and tanks \u2014 topped with what looks like the Tin Man\u2019s hat \u2014 will suck up 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from one of the boilers so it can be shipped out for burial, deep underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is any hope of staving off the worst effects of climate change, many scientists say, this must be part of it \u2014 capturing the carbon that spews from power plants and locking it away, permanently. For now, they contend, the world is too dependent on fossil fuels to do anything less.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If all goes as planned, the effort in Saskatchewan will be the first major one of its kind at a power plant, the equivalent of taking about 250,000 cars off the road. And at least in theory, that carbon dioxide will be kept out of the atmosphere forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThink about how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d said Mr. Zeleny, who recently retired after four decades here, most recently as plant manager.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite President Obama\u2019s push to rein in emissions from power plants across the United States, coal is not going away anytime soon. The administration expects coal will still produce nearly a third of the nation\u2019s electricity in 2030, down from about 40 percent today, even if Mr. Obama\u2019s plan survives the political onslaught against it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The challenge is even more stark overseas. China already burns almost as much coal as all other nations combined, and its appetite keeps expanding. Worldwide, coal consumption in 2020 will be about twice what it was in 2000, according to the United States Energy Information Administration, and will continue to grow for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the abundant natural gas unleashed by fracking, while cleaner than coal, is a major source of greenhouse gases. Ultimately, many scientists say, those emissions will need to be trapped and stored, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you want to carry on using those fossil hydrocarbons, that means cleaning up their emissions,\u201d said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh. Capturing carbon, he said, \u201cis the single best way of doing that.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it is no magic bullet. Because it requires so much energy, sucking up carbon reduces a plant\u2019s ability to make electricity \u2014 the whole point of its existence. There are basic questions of whether carbon dioxide can be safely stored underground. And the technology is expensive. Updating the Saskatchewan plant alone cost $1.2 billion \u2014 two-thirds of which went for the equipment to remove the gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the pine woods of Kemper County, Miss., another carbon-capture effort is taking shape, in a massive new power plant that will be fed a steady diet of coal from the strip mine next door. Bruce Harrington, the operations manager, likened the hulking beast to an anthill: It seems curiously quiet on the outside, but deep within an army of workers is cutting, welding and testing. Disturb it, he said, and thousands of people will come pouring out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Battling delays, the plant\u2019s owner, Southern Company, hopes to have it open next year. But it is more complex than the Saskatchewan effort, and the price tag has ballooned to $5.5 billion, more than double the original estimate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019ll work,\u201d Mr. Harrington said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy at first, but it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though the world has known for decades how to capture carbon dioxide from power plants, scant progress has been made. The United States and other nations have paid for research and helped some projects \u2014 Canada gave $220 million to the Saskatchewan plant\u2019s owner, SaskPower, and Southern Company received $270 million from the Department of Energy \u2014 but the costs are high enough that few other power companies have done much beyond study the concept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere\u2019s no market,\u201d said Edward S. Rubin, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, unless governments impose \u201ca requirement to substantially reduce emissions.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is precisely what is happening here in Saskatchewan, given the Canadian government\u2019s recent restrictions on coal plants both old and new. But whether Mr. Obama\u2019s new rules are aggressive enough to spur a change in the United States remains unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some experts see the Obama policy as a turning point, a moment that could help drive the business of collecting carbon dioxide. Yet the administration has been wary of pushing too hard, warning that any move to force existing coal plants to siphon off their carbon dioxide emissions \u201cwould affect the nationwide cost and supply of electricity.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration plans to require that future coal plants capture their carbon dioxide, a rule that some utilities and politicians, particularly from coal-producing states, have vowed to fight. But for now the mandate is largely an empty one, because coal is so uneconomical compared with natural gas that no one expects many new American coal plants to be built in the foreseeable future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you give power companies a loophole, they\u2019re not going to do the thing,\u201d said Howard J. Herzog, the director of a research program on carbon capture and storage, known as C.C.S., at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cWhy should we even consider C.C.S.? Let\u2019s just do natural gas.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So at a time when many experts say 10 or more projects need to be undertaken to improve the technology and reduce costs, the opposite is happening. Work to modify a coal plant in Texas is expected to start this year, but there are only a few other projects worldwide, all in the planning stage. And as some government subsidies have begun to dry up \u2014 notably, federal stimulus funds in the United States \u2014 several efforts have been delayed or canceled.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Haszeldine said. \u201cGovernments around the world see C.C.S. as a good thing. But they\u2019re not pushing hard enough on enabling that to happen.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Costs</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The technology has been around, in one form or another, for nearly a century, used at some refineries and other industrial plants, including large ones in Illinois, North Dakota, Canada and Norway.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But removing carbon dioxide from the swirl of gases unleashed at a power plant is challenging, akin to plucking just a few colored Ping-Pong balls out of the air from a swarm of mostly white ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To do the job, the equipment is enormous. At the Saskatchewan plant, called Boundary Dam, a liquid chemical latches onto carbon dioxide molecules after being sprayed onto a plume of combustion gases. The \u201cstripper,\u201d where the carbon dioxide is finally pulled away, is 160 feet high \u2014 so high it pokes out of the roof.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the equipment costs, efficiency is lost because some of the steam that would normally generate electricity goes to the stripper instead. And a monstrous motor compresses the carbon dioxide \u2014 until it effectively becomes a liquid \u2014 for transport. All told, capturing the carbon dioxide at Boundary Dam will sap electricity generation by about 20 percent, using as much energy as about 25,000 homes. Experts call it the \u201cenergy penalty.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Storage Concerns</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Injecting liquids deep underground can present problems, too. Pumping wastewater from oil and gas production into the ground has been linked to spates of small earthquakes in Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and other states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The carbon dioxide could taint drinking water, or eventually rise to the surface and bubble into the atmosphere, defeating the entire purpose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the most extreme case, leaking carbon dioxide could harm or kill people. In Cameroon, a volcanic lake suddenly released a cloud of naturally forming carbon dioxide in 1986, suffocating 1,700 people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, carbon dioxide has been buried around the world with few problems. In Norway, a million tons have been stored every year since 1996, injected into sandstone about 3,000 feet beneath the North Sea. (By some estimates, that site alone could store as much carbon dioxide as the world could capture for years.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Picking the right geological features could minimize the risk of earthquakes and leaks. But even then, storage wells would have to be monitored, presumably forever, at a cost someone would have to bear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If done poorly, storing carbon dioxide can cause problems, said David Hawkins, the director of climate programs with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. \u201cBut that\u2019s also true with operating an oil refinery.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An Economic Case</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of Boundary Dam\u2019s carbon dioxide will not simply be buried in storage wells. Instead, the emissions from burning one fossil fuel \u2014 coal \u2014 will become a tool to extract and consume yet another: oil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After being sold and shipped through a 40-mile pipeline to an oil field, the carbon dioxide will be pumped into old wells, where it will mix with the oil inside, making it flow better. The process is known as enhanced oil recovery, and while some of the carbon dioxide will come up with the oil, it will be compressed and injected again. Over time, nearly all of it should remain underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil and gas industry has done this for decades, mostly with naturally occurring carbon dioxide that accumulates underground. But each year in North America, more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide from industry are used as well. Selling that carbon dioxide to the oil industry helps make a business case for capturing it at places like Boundary Dam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The practice could be expanded at many oil fields around the United States and beyond, experts say, potentially storing billions of tons of carbon dioxide and serving as a bridge to the day when it becomes necessary, and economical, to store the gas elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To prod the industry, Congress is weighing incentives, including tax credits, loan guarantees and tax exemptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen by itself,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat who is chairman of a Finance Committee panel on energy. \u201cThere ought to be broad bipartisan support for measures like these.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the apparent incongruity of using carbon dioxide captured from coal to produce more fossil fuels, Mr. Hawkins said his group had struggled with the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOur view is that the most likely consequence is not to encourage more consumption of oil,\u201d he said. Rather, drawing more oil from existing fields will reduce the need to develop new ones, \u201cand that\u2019s an environmental plus,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Future</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Boundary Dam\u2019s owner will evaluate the project for two years before deciding whether to capture carbon dioxide from other boilers at the plant, which it says it could do at lower cost. Part of the calculus is that, less than 10 miles away, there is an almost limitless supply of cheap coal that it otherwise might not be able to use as Canada\u2019s new standards take hold.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe had to figure out if we could continue using coal as a fuel source for the next 100 years,\u201d said Mr. Zeleny, the former employee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the United States and the rest of the world, the prognosis for carbon capture is less clear. If the United States moves forward, China and other countries may make bigger strides as well. This month, the United States and China announced plans for several collaborative research projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHow this will play out over time is hard to tell,\u201d said Professor Rubin of Carnegie Mellon. \u201cInevitably, there will be a balance between technological capability, cost and political realities.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Others were even more upbeat. Dan Reicher, who directs the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University, said the Obama administration\u2019s recent moves on emissions could be a catalyst.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe\u2019re finally getting some clarity on where we\u2019re headed on carbon emissions,\u201d Mr. Reicher said, arguing that collecting carbon dioxide could become a significant industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe need every tool in the toolbox to address climate change,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE BIG FIX: Articles in this series are examining\npotential solutions to climate\nchange.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

And we know what we need to do.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden approved a federal disaster declaration for the area Sunday, and officials warned that toxic waste runoff and sediment from the fire could threaten the watershed around Lake Tahoe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's trip to California reflects not only political imperatives -- he's campaigning for Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is trying to fend off a recall campaign on Tuesday -- but also his administration's increasing focus on wildfires. Biden has participated in regular briefings on the issue, and he's pushing for more spending on infrastructure to mitigate climate change, which scientists say is intensifying forest fires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have not seen this much attention on what I would call good forest management and wildland management as I have with this administration,\" Cal Fire Director Thom Porter said. \"In my 30-year career in this, I haven't seen any attention like this.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom, who greeted Biden when he landed on Air Force One and accompanied him for a briefing on wildfires, praised his commitment with an implicit swipe at former President Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're not sparring partners,\" Newsom said. \"We're working partners.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before arriving in Sacramento, Biden stopped in Boise, Idaho, where he became the first president to visit the National Interagency Fire Center since it was founded five decades ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You know the time of the year when the air fills with smoke and the sky turns a little orange,\" he said in Boise. \"But that time of year is getting earlier every year.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been an estimated 44,000 wildfires this year, with 5.4 million acres burned nationwide.

The state budget allocates $1.5 billion for wildfire prevention work that includes clearing brush and forest management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a meeting with Biden and other governors in late July, Newsom said the state needed more federal support to increase the number of firefighters and improve its fleet of aircraft.

We're here to help. Each Thursday contributor Bjorn Lomborg will provide some important background so readers can have a better understanding of the true effects of climate change and the real costs of climate policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to construct climate disasters. You just find a current, disconcerting trend and project it into the future, while ignoring everything humanity could do to adapt. For instance, one widely reported study found that heat waves could kill thousands more Americans by the end of the century if global warming continues apace\u2014but only if you assume people won't use more air conditioning. Yes, the climate is likely to change, but so is human behavior in response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adaptation doesn't make the cost of global warming go away entirely, but it does reduce it dramatically. Higher temperatures will shrink harvests if farmers keep growing the same crops, but they're likely to adapt by growing other varieties or different plants altogether. Corn production in North America has shifted away from the Southeast toward the Upper Midwest, where farmers take advantage of longer growing seasons and less-frequent extreme heat. When sea levels rise, governments build defenses\u2014like the levees, flood walls and drainage systems that protected New Orleans from much of Hurricane Ida's ferocity this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, many in the media push unrealistic projections of climate catastrophes, while ignoring adaptation. A new study documents how the biggest bias in studies on the rise of sea levels is their tendency to ignore human adaptation, exaggerating flood risks in 2100 by as much as 1,300 times. It is also evident in the breathless tone of most reporting: The Washington Post frets that sea level rise could \" make 187 million people homeless ,\" CNN fears an \" underwater future ,\" and USA Today agonizes over tens of trillions of dollars in projected annual flood damage . All three rely on studies that implausibly assume no society across the world will make any adaptation whatever for the rest of the century. This isn't reporting but scaremongering.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You can see how far from reality these sorts of projections are in one heavily cited study , depicted in the graph nearby If you assume no society will adapt to any sea-level rise between now and 2100, you'll find that vast areas of the world will be routinely flooded, causing $55 trillion in damage annually in 2100 (expressed in 2005 dollars), or about 5% of global gross domestic product. But as the study emphasizes, \"in reality, societies are likely to adapt.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By raising the height of dikes, the study shows that humanity can negate almost all that terrible projected damage by 2100. Only 15,000 people would be flooded every year, which is a remarkable improvement compared with the 3.4 million people flooded in 2000. The total cost of damage, investments in new dikes, and maintenance costs of existing dikes will fall sixfold between now and 2100 to 0.008% of world GDP.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adaptation is much more effective than climate regulations at staving off flood risks. Compare the two types of policies in isolation. Without any climate mitigation to help, dikes would still safeguard more than 99.99% of the flood victims you'd see if global warming continued on current trends. Instead of 187 million people flooded in 2100, there would be only 15,000. Climate policy achieves much less on its own. Without adaptation, even stringent regulations that keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius would reduce the number of flood victims only down to 85 million a year by the end of the century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stringent climate policy still has only a mild effect when used in concert with dikes: Instead of the 15,000 flood victims you'd get with only adaptation, you'd have 10,000. And getting there would cost hundreds of trillions of dollars, which is hardly mitigated by the $40 billion drop in total flood damage and dike costs climate regulations would achieve. As I've explained in these pages before, this kind of policy has a high human cost: the tens of millions of people pricey climate regulations relegate to poverty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You don't have to portend doom to take climate change seriously. Ignoring the benefits of adaptation may make for better headlines, but it badly misinforms readers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.

In addition to rating governments on meaningful financial criteria, in March the biggest of the top three credit-rating firms began to apply an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, rating system.

State officials, including myself, recently wrote a letter to S&P objecting to the ESG indicators and ratings it has assigned to Utah and calling for the company to withdraw them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ESG is sometimes dressed up to look objective with quantitative \"metrics\" and complex \"analytical frameworks.\" But this blurs the distinction between subjective judgments and objective financial assessments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>S&P Global says it \"incorporates [ESG] risks and opportunities into the credit rating analysis\" of public issuers. This includes ambiguous and open-ended categories such as how a state scores on \"managing carbon,\" \"political unrest stemming from community and social issues\" and \"adverse publicity that results in reputation risk.\" Leaving no doubt as to the measurement's subjectivity, S&P notes, \"reflecting ESG risks and opportunities within our credit rating analysis will require a qualitative view of an entity's capacity to anticipate and plan for a variety of emerging risks.\" Unlike quantifiable financial metrics, this qualitative view depends entirely on the beliefs of whoever constructs it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to see that those beliefs are left-wing. S&P assigns a lower ESG score to states that have both \"physical risks\" like earthquakes and natural disasters and a larger percentage of their economy tied to natural resource extraction, such as Texas, Alaska and Louisiana. S&P's Environmental category, after noting federal-state partnerships' financial mitigation of natural disasters, focuses its assessment on the costs of making the transition to \"net zero\" and the policy changes it predicts will be necessary to \"curtail\" greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, if a state's finances are overly concentrated on any one particular industry this will affect its financial outlook because of the risk that revenue could decline should that industry's fortunes contract. But a traditional credit rating takes into account the diversity of industry in a state already, so why create an ESG metric that could be politicized? Instead of focusing on the financial risk associated with economic concentration, the ESG metric highlights if a state or local government allows what S&P thinks is too much oil, gas or coal extraction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further, there are national security, economic and even environmental benefits for U.S. states to produce traditional energy. Many countries are searching for sources of natural gas and oil so they can lower their dependence on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. In that environment, states like Texas, Alaska and Louisiana have a tremendous market advantage and could see improved cash flows. Not only are their fossil fuel revenues benefiting a free democracy, Russia's natural gas exports to Europe burn 41% dirtier than American natural gas. Exporting U.S. natural gas would create a significant environmental benefit. Authoritarian regimes like Russia threaten, among other things, the environment, human rights, free societies and democratic government\u2014all factors that should be important to ESG proponents. That S&P's ESG metrics completely ignored or missed these variables exposes some of the major flaws of ESG ratings. Such scores place a value judgment on political issues that do not have one right or wrong answer, are highly complex, and are impossible to predict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Russian situation has shown, ESG assessments depend on variables that can change rapidly. Before Russia attacked Ukraine, Europe was moving away from fossil fuels and military spending. That changed almost overnight. This is why markets are so valuable; they encapsulate many different views of the future and their organic structure allows for quick adaptation. ESG scores, by contrast, rigidly hold to one viewpoint and are slow to pick up on changes in the world. The minds behind S&P's ESG metrics seem to believe that a transition to green energy is inevitable and therefore punish states that produce traditional energy for \"climate transition risk.\" But no one really knows what this \"climate transition\" will look like. There are no widely accepted, economically viable alternatives to fossil fuels in the market. No one knows where they'll come from, what they'll be or when they'll arrive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ESG metrics' false certainty about future events, and consequent inability to keep up with unanticipated current events, causes capital to be misallocated. They create bubbles in favored industries while starving others that could be profitable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The solutions to our most difficult challenges\u2014such as climate change\u2014can come only through innovation. Foisting rigid ESG factors onto the market discourages innovation by mandating conformity, penalizing creativity and punishing the industry with the greatest incentive to find alternatives\u2014the energy sector. Fracking has reduced U.S. carbon emissions immensely, but it could cost you under S&P's ESG metrics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Utah has prudently managed its finances over decades and as a result maintains the highest possible credit rating from all major firms, allowing the state to borrow money at the lowest rates and save taxpayer dollars. But under the new ESG regime, those financial factors may be supplanted by subjective, political ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These metrics also threaten Utah and other states' democratic sovereignty. The ESG disclosures many corporations have felt compelled to release have also led to frivolous legal action and shareholder resolutions, an additional fiscal drag on businesses. Extending this regime into the municipal sphere is an invitation to litigation and other coercive tactics that will sabotage states' self-determination and independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States like Utah value our constitutional republic, which has ensured freedom, and free markets, which have fostered innovation and generated prosperity for generations. Any states, governmental jurisdictions, corporations, individuals, and investors who also hold those beliefs should join us in standing against ESG.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Oaks is treasurer of Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>S&P Hits U.S. States With Politicized Credit Scores</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Marlo Oaks\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

You recycle. You turn off the faucet when you brush your teeth. But you're not going to forgo a flight to a tropical paradise and top-notch accommodations, even though planes emit greenhouse gases and routine hotel practices, like washing the linens each day, hurt the environment. After all, you love to travel -- and well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's still hope. To help you sleep easier on those high-thread-count sheets, here are 10 small ways to travel a little more responsibly, even when taking that trip to Hawaii.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flying (especially on short flights) is among the least sustainable ways to travel, according to groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund . Some airlines allow you to try to compensate for the carbon footprint you create when flying, however, by buying what are known as carbon offsets, or various ways to reduce greenhouse gases. Passengers on airlines like Delta and United can calculate their carbon footprint on the airline websites, which equate the size of a trip's carbon footprint with a dollar figure. They can then donate their money or miles to a carbon reduction project such as forest conservation or renewable energy. Airlines are not the only ones offering offsets, though. Amtrak , for instance, has a rail calculator and allows you to offset your train trip through Carbonfund.org .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some environmental organizations have said that offset programs are problematic . And a number of them have suggested that the carbon calculators on airline sites are not precise enough because they do not take into consideration factors like whether you're flying first class (which results in a larger carbon footprint because you're taking up space that could otherwise have been used to transport more people). Still, contributing to such programs is better than flying and doing nothing. For a more precise calculator, check out carbonfootprint.com .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you can't walk, bike. If you can't bike, take a subway, bus or train. If you rent a car, request a hybrid. If you hire a driver, try to car pool. Services such as Lyft and Uber offer car-pooling, though the notion that they are environmentally friendly is being studied ; researchers at NRDC Urban Solutions and the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, are analyzing whether such services are good for the environment or if they are merely congesting roads, competing with public transportation and encouraging people to be driven instead of walking. Bottom line: If you have the option, walk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The greenest vacation is one in which you don't travel far, impossible for those who wish to see the world. Airbnb has argued that home sharing is a greener option than hotels, though its study published in 2014 -- which said that using Airbnb results in a significant reduction in energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste, and relied mainly on guest and host survey responses from February to April of that year -- was not scientific. But if home sharing isn't for you, you can still make any hotel stay greener by reusing your sheets and towels (many hotels give guests the option to not change their linens each day), taking short showers, turning off the air-conditioner (or using a fan instead), turning down the thermostat and using less electricity by forgoing the hair dryer and switching off the lights when you're not in the room. You can also choose to stay in hotels that have sustainable practices like harvesting rainwater and not heating or air-conditioning rooms or spaces that are unoccupied. To find them, check out a site like the Green Hotels Association . Expedia.com also has some tips for green travel. Not sure your desired hotel is green? The Nature Conservancy has 10 questions you can ask to find out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millions of barrels of oil are needed to produce the plastic water bottles consumed by Americans alone, according to the Pacific Institute , a sustainable water think tank. In 2007 the group said that the amount of oil used in the production of plastic water bottles was enough energy to fuel more than a million cars and light trucks for a year. You can do your part to curb emissions by always traveling with a reusable bottle. And coffee and tea drinkers can help when it comes to saving paper by carrying reusable travel mugs instead of to-go cups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heavier your luggage, the more fuel is needed. Even something as small as a cellphone multiplied across the number of passengers affects the weight of a plane. Besides, it's easier and more fun to travel when you're not loaded down with bags.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now we know not to print documents when we don't have to, and recycle whatever paper we do use. Paper production and pulpwood harvesting contribute to climate change and \" threaten some of the last remaining natural forests and the people and wildlife that depend on them ,\" according to the WWF . E-tickets, meanwhile, have come a long way from their wonky early days. Having your smartphone scanned at airports and train stations is often seamless.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eat locally sourced food and buy locally made souvenirs -- and carry them back to your hotel in a reusable bag instead of plastic. In addition to supporting local economies, shopping locally generally means there's less packaging. And items don't need to be flown or shipped in, cutting down on waste and greenhouse gas emissions. As the Michigan State University Extension has pointed out, buying locally grown food can help maintain farmland and green space. To cut emissions even more significantly, reduce or eliminate red meat; its production is carbon-intensive .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Allow your computer and other devices to sleep when you're not using them. It's an energy saver that's good for their battery life and for the earth, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many environmentally minded groups including the Nature Conservancy , the Sierra Club and the WWF offer eco-trips and outings that strive not to harm natural resources, wildlife or people. Backroads and REI Adventures also offer tours that aim to be environmentally low-impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pass your green travel habits on to others. You'll multiply their effect -- something you'll need to do given all the trips you hope to take.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/travel/ecotourism-green-travel-tips.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

But it and other megafires in the West have left a footprint much larger than the evergreen forests they level and the towns they decimate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Summer after summer, California, a global leader in battling air pollution from vehicles, sends giant clouds of haze filled with health-damaging particles across the country. Even as far as Denver, 1,100 miles to the east, the Dixie Fire has helped create a pall of noxious smoke during an already scorching summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By one measure, wildfires \u2014 intensified by drought and climate change \u2014 are the largest source of potentially deadly air pollution in California. And in recent weeks, the accumulating haze and smoke from California\u2019s fires and high ozone levels have turned the air in Salt Lake City and Denver into some of the dirtiest in the world, more harmful than Delhi\u2019s or Beijing\u2019s on many recent days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Smoke from wildfires across western Canada, Oregon and California has stained the skies and fouled the air as far away as Iowa, Minnesota and even New York City. Recent research suggests that the smoke may actually grow more toxic as it ages, undergoes chemical changes and blows across the country, reacting with sunlight and other molecules floating in the air. Over time, smoke may form reactive compounds that can be especially damaging to the body once they are inhaled.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt gets worse with age,\u201d said Mary Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at the Sean N.

What sets the Dixie Fire apart from the megafires of previous years is the vast area it has torn through in the mountains northeast of the state capital, Sacramento. With 489,287 acres burned, the fire is still only 21 percent contained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the exhausted firefighters battling the Dixie Fire in and around Gold Rush towns are warning that the season of smoke and fire could grip the drought-stricken West for months to come.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

Improving auto fuel efficiency standards threaten to depress oil consumption eventually, and fleets of electric vehicles are gradually emerging in China and a few other important markets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps most troubling for oil companies over the long term is the goal \u2014 agreed to last December by virtually every country in the world at a climate conference in Paris \u2014 of staving off a rise in average global temperatures of more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, has said that to reach that goal, two-thirds of the global coal, oil and natural gas reserves still underground may never be burned without some improbable technological breakthrough in dealing with the carbon emissions. This position has been echoed by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil industry has experienced global crises, booms and busts for over a century, and few energy experts think it faces an existential threat in the immediate future. The world will still need oil and gas for decades, and normal declines in existing fields oblige further drilling. But change is almost certainly coming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAny energy company in the world that makes its strategy without considering climate change policies is making a major mistake,\u201d Mr. Birol said in an interview, \u201cnot only a major mistake for the climate but also for their own profits and for their own shareholders, because climate change policies represent a fundamental challenge to business as usual.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Energy Agency\u2019s projections of future global oil demand include one possibility in which demand could drop more than 20 percent from today\u2019s levels, to 74 million barrels a day by 2040, if measures are put in place to keep global warming at levels proposed at the Paris conference. As coal burning declines precipitously and renewable energy grows steadily, natural gas demand will rise only modestly by 2040 even as the global population grows, if the world truly wants to come to grips with climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, many oil executives view a different path as more likely. Exxon Mobil , for example, projects that global demand for oil will keep growing \u2014 by just over 13 percent from today, to 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and many other companies are investing heavily in natural gas as a lower-carbon answer to growing global energy needs. They view gas as a clean fuel of the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe continue to believe fossil fuels will have a significant and important role to play for as far as we can see,\u201d Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, said at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in May.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which way the world will turn is still in doubt. Most oil executives and independent experts agree that the ambitious Paris target will be challenging to reach, and that reduced burning of fossil fuels will require big technological and policy shifts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Governments will probably need to be more proactive in deploying nuclear power, which is virtually carbon-free, many experts say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coal-fired power plants will need to be equipped with costly carbon capture and sequestration systems. Higher prices for carbon-based fuels are needed in countries like the United States to depress demand and encourage investments in nuclear power and carbon capture and sequestration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Advanced biofuels must be developed to produce renewable fuels without competing with food supplies. Better and cheaper batteries are needed to make electric cars affordable, while recharging stations need to be deployed far more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of those strategies are costly, politically charged or technically challenging. Big scientific breakthroughs will be needed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oil companies have tried to offer solutions to remain relevant. Exxon Mobil, for instance, has financed research into carbon capture and sequestration and lobbied for a carbon tax. Shell has been a big investor in Brazilian biofuels, while Chevron has long been one of the biggest investors in geothermal energy. The French oil company Total is making a major effort in solar power .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco, pledged last week to jointly invest $1 billion over the next decade to develop systems to capture and store emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several oil and gas companies have already moved quickly to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from their exploration and transmission operations. Some farsighted executives have even suggested that their natural gas production could eventually be a major source of hydrogen for fuel cells because methane is hydrogen-rich.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it\u2019s just a start. With their scientific and engineering prowess and capital muscle, many oil companies have the capacity to retrofit their business plans if and when they are forced to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeremy Bentham, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s vice president for global business environment, said Shell and other oil companies could adapt and prosper to meet the world\u2019s energy needs, which should continue to grow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOur portfolio mix would adjust over time,\u201d he said, \u201csuch that the level of the demand for oil would be met and the level of demand for overall energy would be met.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bentham acknowledged that the world must leave some fossil fuels in the ground, but that the global community and not just oil companies must take action to reduce demand for carbon-based fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cTo have a demand at a much lower level you need a significant restructuring of mobility systems with more compact cities and with more public transport that can be electrified,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles that can take a longer range \u2014 a whole restructuring that isn\u2019t driven by energy production.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The restructuring of a new energy system is years if not decades away, and signs that important change is coming have been uneven.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The electric car market is growing slowly in the United States and most of Europe because of high costs and range limitations, although it is advancing faster in China. Toyota, Hyundai and Honda already offer hydrogen fuel-cell cars in select markets, and other companies are testing models that would emit nothing but water from the tailpipe, but major market penetration could be decades away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automobiles are becoming far more efficient, although cheap gasoline is causing a surge in consumer demand in the United States for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the petroleum industry, even as the price of oil has ticked up modestly in recent months, there are multiple signs of stress in a world of cheap hydrocarbons and rising environmental concerns. What once looked like a rush to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic has stalled . Investments in Canada\u2019s oil sands have slowed, partly as a result of low commodity prices, but also because environmentalists have been successful in opposing the Keystone XL and other pipelines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, the hydraulic fracturing revolution that led to a frenzy of drilling in the United States is taking off in Argentina , but hardly anywhere else. The collapse in oil and natural gas prices has led to scores of bankruptcies, mounting debts and the slashing of exploration budgets. Attorneys general in several states are investigating charges that Exxon Mobil raised doubts about climate change while its scientists warned about the dangers of carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this new world, European companies have been relatively more responsive to change. Many have embraced shareholder proposals to acknowledge the need to limit the rise in global temperatures and to test operations to see how they would perform in a carbon-constrained world. Such proposals have mostly been rejected by the American majors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statoil, the Norwegian national company, has agreed to accelerate its investments in renewable energy, announcing new investment decisions totaling more than $1 billion. Among these are the world\u2019s first floating offshore wind park and one of the world\u2019s largest venture funds dedicated to renewables . The projects in Statoil\u2019s renewable energy portfolio now have a combined capacity to power more than one million European homes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe recognize that only a certain amount of CO2 can be emitted to reach the 2-degree target,\u201d said Bjorn Otto Sverdrup, Statoil\u2019s senior vice president for sustainability. \u201cThen you have to accept the idea of a carbon budget.

The two sides are squaring off over a U.S. Bureau of Land Management plan to allocate some 10 million acres of public land in the California desert for conservation, recreation and clean-energy installations like the 550-megawatt, or million watt, Desert Sunlight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The solar lobby argues that the current draft plan would throttle the industry's expansion, making it difficult to meet the nation's renewable-energy goals. Environmentalists want to preserve \"connectivity\" between areas of vital species habitat so that tortoises and other animals can move around and adjust to warming conditions, which could drive them to higher, cooler elevations. For the animals, reaching distant mountain ranges might mean crossing flat stretches where, otherwise, companies might put solar installations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal would allocate 388,000 acres of federal land for renewable-energy development, while protecting 5.3 million acres for conservation reasons and 3.8 million acres for recreation. (The last two involve some overlap.) \"Over twice the amount of important desert tortoise lands\" would be protected under the plan, the agency determined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Why the administration would on one hand call for greater use of renewable energy on public lands as a way to hit carbon-reduction targets while cutting off access to the land needed ... is lost on us,\" said Dan Whitten, vice president for communications at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the main trade group of the booming solar industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The industry's stance on the initiative - dubbed the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan - has in turn triggered criticism in the conservation world and spurred a counter-mobilization in the plan's favor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We've been at this for eight years. The industry has been at the table, and to have these issues come up ... at the 11th hour seems a bit not only mystifying but disingenuous on their part for not bringing them up earlier,\" said Ileene Anderson, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of a number of prominent environmental groups backing the plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An 'umbrella' species</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's behind it all is a desert that, far from being deserted, is in high demand - presenting a complex patchwork of urban areas, national parks and monuments, military bases, lands of major cultural significance to Native Americans, and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a branch of the Interior Department, has been charged with managing 10 million publicly owned acres of this landscape since 1976, a period that coincided with a steady decline in the population of the tortoise, a long-lived and slow-reproducing reptile that digs telltale burrows in the dry earth to keep cool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tortoise is threatened by roads, off-road vehicles and other factors - including a changing climate. It is considered an \"umbrella\" species because its habitat overlaps with so many others. \"By protecting the tortoise, you protect all the other species in the desert,\" said Mark Massar, a wildlife biologist with the BLM.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Concern for the tortoise mounted as the desert solar boom hit in the late 2000s, buoyed by President Obama's economic stimulus act and California's ever-more-ambitious targets for renewable energy, which currently require power companies to get 50 percent of their electricity from clean sources by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conflicts were epitomized by the Ivanpah solar plant in the Mojave Desert. One environmental group, the Western Watersheds Project, sued the federal government in 2011 to stop the solar project. That didn't happen, but developers ultimately had to spend millions of dollars to protect desert tortoises at and around the site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is in this context that the BLM began a protracted process to apportion the land, collaborating with federal and California partner agencies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For renewable energy, one of the largest designated areas lies in eastern Riverside County, halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix along Interstate 10. The region, called the Chuckwalla Valley, is part of a dry, harsh landscape that once supported massive World War II training exercises overseen by Army Gen. George S. Patton, who was preparing an Allied invasion force to go into North Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One advantage of this valley is that it contains many hot, low-lying areas that are less-desirable habitat for tortoises, which prefer higher elevations. Even conservationists say they are okay - mostly - with solar installations out here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a pretty decent area to be what you might call a sacrifice area for solar,\" Joan Taylor, a longtime desert conservation advocate who chairs the Sierra Club's California/Nevada Desert Committee, said as she surveyed Desert Sunlight recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'More than enough acres'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The solar-energy industry has moved quickly to lay claim to the area. To the east of Desert Sunlight, near the Arizona border, NextEra is finishing construction on another large array, the two-part Blythe project, a 235-megawatt installation covering more than three square miles. Surrounding the facility are not one but two fences. One of the fences extends 18 inches below ground to prevent desert tortoises from burrowing beneath it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But solar-energy backers fear that finding other suitable sites may be difficult under the federal plan. One charge is that some of the renewable-energy zones overlap with ecologically sensitive areas, such as sand dunes that are home to the Mojave fringe-toed lizard, and \"microphyll woodlands,\" areas of taller trees, like ironwood and palo verde, that are key for birds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Danielle Mills, a senior policy adviser for the Large-scale Solar Association, recently toured one of these woodlands, which grow in desert washes that receive occasional flooding, near the Blythe array.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Companies wouldn't come here in the first place, but on top of that, there's a requirement to avoid it,\" said Mills, whose organization's members include NextEra and First Solar, which originally developed Desert Sunlight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The BLM does not dispute that overlaps exist. Even within designated development areas, \"there's still going to be some sensitive resources that are going to have to be avoided,\" said Mike Sintetos, who leads the BLM's renewable-energy program in California. \"We acknowledge that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sintetos said the agency thinks there will still be \"more than enough acres available for the amount of megawatts that we think are going to come out of the desert.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The wind-energy industry is not happy with the plan, either. \"I've never been so frustrated in my entire life. It was like beating my head against a brick wall for seven years,\" said Nancy Rader, executive director of the California Wind Energy Association.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But conservationists counter that California's two large utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, have voiced support for the plan. And BLM California spokeswoman Martha Maciel adds that by channeling the solar industry to areas that are less conflict-prone, development will be a lot easier and litigation rarer. \"It provides them a level of certainty that does not exist today,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How much is needed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One key point of disagreement is just how much additional solar-energy infrastructure California, and the rest of the United States, will need - and how much should be sited on public lands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Karen Douglas, one of the California Energy Commission's five members, argues that the 388,000 acres should be more than enough - especially considering that the solar-energy industry will have the option to develop on private lands, too, and in other parts of the state, such as the San Joaquin Valley.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She described a scenario in which, assuming that California will need 20,000 megawatts of desert renewable energy by 2040, 12 percent of the federal lands designated under the plan would supply about 40 percent of the goal. Private lands could then accommodate the rest, she said. \"Large-scale renewable energy, especially on public land, is not the only game in town,\" Douglas said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the solar industry counters that it doesn't know how much private land will be available. Originally, the plan was to work with California's counties to simultaneously obtain private land and allocate public lands. But later, the plan was split to pursue separate tracks, one factor that is now driving discord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate marks a clear coming of age for the solar industry, a sign that the growing appetite for the energy it produces will begin to conflict with other interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no free ride with energy,\" said the Sierra Club's Taylor. \"They all have costs, and large-scale solar is among them.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>chris.mooney@washpost.com\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 10}

Leading politicians in the state, from the governor down to many mayors, have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, backing industry over environmental concerns, said easing emissions rules would help stimulate auto manufacturing. He vowed \n last week \n to loosen the regulations. Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of supporting stricter standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But California can write its own standards because of a longstanding waiver granted under the Clean Air Act , giving the state \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest auto market \u2014 major sway over the auto industry. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D.C., follow California\u2019s standards, a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAll of the evidence \u2014 call it science, call it economics \u2014 shows that if anything, these standards should be even more aggressive,\u201d said the board member Daniel Sperling, a transportation expert at the University of California, Davis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The board\u2019s chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, was even more pointed, admonishing automakers for milking Mr. Trump for favors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s take action today, and let\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long a forerunner in environmental regulation, California worked with the Obama administration on joint standards that became a crucial part of the country\u2019s effort to combat climate change . Officials said the regulations would reduce the country\u2019s oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and eliminate six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution over the lifetime of the cars affected. That amounts to more than a year\u2019s worth of America\u2019s carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adopted in 2012, the standards would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54.5 miles per gallon, forcing automakers to speed development of highly fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars . Mr. Trump intends to lower that target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday\u2019s unanimous vote by the 14-member board, which affirmed the higher standards through 2025, amounted to a public rejection of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, the question is how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the Trump administration will handle California\u2019s dissent. The administration could choose to revoke California\u2019s waiver, at which point experts expect the state would sue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California sued the George W. Bush administration after it challenged California\u2019s waiver in 2007. Mr. Obama reversed the federal challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House and the E.P.A., which have not yet determined their plans for the California waiver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several states that follow California\u2019s rules raced to its defense. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way together,\u201d said Steven Flint, director of the air resources division of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. \u201cWe\u2019re with you, and we believe in what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists and public health experts have criticized the automakers\u2019 resistance to emissions rules under the Trump administration as an about-face. All major automakers previously voiced support for the more stringent standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nation\u2019s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d for the auto industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion by 2025 to comply.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A separate study by the International Council on Clean Transportation , a think tank supporting emissions controls, has estimated that the cost of meeting those standards could be overstated by as much as 40 percent. And auto industry experts have warned that a slowdown in America\u2019s shift toward efficient cars could leave its auto market a global laggard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, an industry trade group, said before the California vote that companies agreed on the need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. But he urged California to fall into line with federal rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is a more effective way forward than regulatory systems that are different,\u201d Mr. Bozzella said. He also suggested that demand for clean cars remained relatively tiny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was required, he said, were standards that \u201cbalance innovation, compliance and consumer needs and wants.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automakers have also been critical of a California\u2019s zero-emission vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of electric cars and trucks in California and nine other states. The board voted on Friday to continue that program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Politicians in California, one of the country\u2019s most Democratic states, have embraced acting as a bulwark against Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, promising to defend the state\u2019s laws on immigration, health care and the environment. Many cities in California have broad \u201csanctuary\u201d policies aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. State law also provides some protections for immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even at the federal level, the president\u2019s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration would then need to propose its own replacement fuel-economy standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the Trump administration\u2019s move to ease emissions rules is the first part of an expected \n ass \n a \n u \n lt on Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will direct the E.P.A. to dismantle Obama-era regulations on pollution from coal-fired power plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not think carbon dioxide is a primary cause of global warming, a statement at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bonnie Holmes-Gen of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe public is bearing a huge cost \u2014 billions of dollars in health expenses and damage from climate,\u201d Ms. Holmes-Gen said. \u201cI urge California to keep us on track.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about California\u2019s upholding its auto emissions standards misstated the position that Steven Flint holds at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. He is director of the air resources division, not the director of the department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/energy-environment/california-upholds-emissions-standards-setting-up-face-off-with-trump.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: HIROKO TABUCHI\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}
{"id": "txt/1716193956.xml.txt", "text": "<div id='source_options'><p>Pope Francis|Pope|Roman Catholic Church|N/A|Religious leader|Pope Francis is referenced for his views on social issues and the dignity of individuals, emphasizing the importance of 'religious liberty.'</p><p>Ben Rhodes|Deputy National Security Adviser|Obama administration|N/A|Bureaucrat|Ben Rhodes is considering the alignment of the Obama administration's work with the values emphasized by Pope Francis.</p><p>Barack Obama|President|United States of America|N/A|Politician|President Obama is quoted praising Pope Francis for his support on environmental protection and diplomatic relations with Cuba.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EVEN BEFORE he became the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, Pope Francis had fashioned a more political agenda in visiting Washington than his predecessors. Like popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II before him, Pope Francis toured the city and warmly greeted many of the thousands of faithful who turned out to see him under brilliant blue skies. But his popular outreach was matched with remarkably pointed messages to the political establishment that gathered to hear him at the Capitol and the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pope Francis's first political pitch arguably came when he introduced himself as the \"son of an immigrant family\" and called the United States a country \"largely built by such families.\" Soon afterward he delighted President Obama by explicitly praising his climate change policies. Then he called for the defense of \"religious liberty . . . from everything that would threaten or compromise it.\" In case anyone was uncertain what he meant by that, the pontiff later made an unscheduled stop at the home of the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have led the fight against the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before Congress, Pope Francis returned to the subjects of immigration and global warming, along with prison reform and the death penalty, the arms trade, wealth inequality and even the role of money in the political system. He was particularly forceful in urging acceptance of immigrants, saying that in view of the \"thousands [who] travel north in search of a better life,\" Americans \"must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The political messages were particularly striking in view of the pope's performance in Cuba, his previous stop, where he said nothing about political or religious freedom. That, too, was a contrast with Pope John Paul II, who spoke explicitly about human rights when he toured the island in 1998. Perhaps Pope Francis believed that the open U.S. political system allowed him to speak more freely than in Communist-ruled Cuba without offending the local political authorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, some of the pope's Washington hosts appeared eager to take advantage of his words. \"How can we make use of the enormous platform that the pope's visit provides to lift up the work we're doing and demonstrate how it's consistent with the direction that's coming from the pope?\" is the way deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes put it. Mr. Obama certainly tried, telling Pope Francis that \"you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet\" and thanking him for \"invaluable\" support in his administration's renewal of relations with Cuba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional Republicans cheered when the pope obliquely mentioned his opposition to abortion, and some will seize on his references to \"religious freedom\" in the context of Obamacare. We'd like to hope the Republican presidential debate, which has been poisoned by Donald Trump's ugly and false attacks on migrants from Mexico, might be swayed by the pope's compassion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all likelihood, however, it won't be. In the past, popes have had the most political impact when they spoke up for people who were silenced; think of Pope John Paul II in Communist Poland. In the United States, there is no shortage of advocates -- and opponents -- of Pope Francis's various stands. His is a powerful voice, but in Washington's debates it will remain one among many.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

The fill sinks naturally, and the subsidence worsens as the water table rises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Investigators are just beginning to try to unravel what caused the Champlain Towers South to collapse into a heap of rubble, leaving at least 159 people missing as of Friday. Experts on sea-level rise and climate change caution that it is too soon to speculate whether rising seas helped destabilize the oceanfront structure. The 40-year-old building was relatively new compared with others on its stretch of beach in the town of Surfside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it is already clear that South Florida has been on the front lines of sea-level rise and that the effects of climate change on the infrastructure of the region \u2014 from septic systems to aquifers to shoreline erosion \u2014 will be a management problem for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Champlain Towers South building was recently found to have been sinking in the 1990s and may have continued to sink since then, according to Shimon Wdowinski, a professor at Florida International University's department of earth and environment who has studied the area.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wdowinski co-wrote a paper published in April 2020 that said satellite imagery showed a 12-story condominium building in the eastern part of the Miami Beach area had sunk by about two millimeters per year between 1993 and 1999. Wdowinski said in an interview Thursday that it was the Champlain Towers South building.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I was shocked to see it collapsed,\" Wdowinski said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Land subsidence is a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the surface when material that supports it is displaced or removed, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Erosion and the disappearance of groundwater are two of several factors that cause it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wdowinski, whose findings were first reported by USA Today, cautioned that it was not clear whether the subsidence he found was connected to the building's collapse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It appears to be something very localized to one building, so I would think the problem was more likely to be related to the building itself,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The roof on the 136-unit building was being replaced and other repairs were planned, according to an attorney for the condominium association, Kenneth Direktor. He said the building was \"thoroughly inspected\" recently as part of a process in which buildings in Surfside must be recertified every 40 years and that the report on the inspection had been completed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There was nothing in the report that would have indicated a life-safety concern,\" Direktor said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jim McGuinness, Surfside's building official, said the city was aware that the report was close to being completed but that officials were still awaiting its submission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miami and nearby beach communities have experienced substantial sea-level rise, up to 12 inches over the past century, according to some estimates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That includes nearly six inches since the mid-1990s, according to a Capital Weather Gang analysis of federal data. That has led to a 320 percent jump in nuisance flooding in the area over the past 23 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a new storm-water master plan released by the city of Miami in April, it would have to spend nearly $4 billion over the next 40 years to protect the city from floods that result from sea-level rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The money would be spent on six-foot-high sea walls, massive underground pipes and wells to control a rapid influx of water. Regardless of how much the city spends, some residents would have to retreat from areas that cannot be protected from flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The porous limestone underneath Miami allows the rising seas to filter up through the ground, causing flooding during high tides even on sunny days. The groundwater surge threatens freshwater supplies and septic systems, which are already failing in Miami-Dade County.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mix of swelling groundwater and tidal cycles juiced by climate change means coastal buildings and their concrete foundations spend more time in water than they did in the past, said Albert Slap, the chief executive of RiskFootprint, a Boca Raton, Fla.-based company that assesses buildings' vulnerability to hazards such as storm surge and flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a tragic, devastating event, and it could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine-type event,\" he said. \"It's not just one building. This could be something that could affect other buildings.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Slap noted that many coastal structures built on sand that have underground parking lots already rely on around-the-clock sump pumps to keep out groundwater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The groundwater enters the pores of the concrete and ultimately weakens it and erodes it,\" he said. \"So the foundations are subject to a lot of geological forces that could compact the soil underneath. It could cause voids. We just don't know.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Video from the scene of the collapse showed rescue workers in the basement parking garage working in knee-deep water, although the source of that water was unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harold R. Wanless, a professor at the University of Miami and an expert on sea-level rise, cautioned that there are too many other possible explanations for the building collapse to speculate whether sea-level rise played a role in the tragedy. But investigators need to get to the bottom of that, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We've got to find out what it is,\" he said, \"because it makes living or working in high-rises very unattractive right now. Why did this happen?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wanless said the area of the collapse in Surfside was still a few feet above normal sea level. One of the possibilities that must be taken into consideration is whether a sinkhole or some type of collapse happened under the building, he said, but he added that the area has not been known for sinkholes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"About 20 feet down is limestone, but that's not an area that has had any sinkholes that I'm aware of,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A search of the Florida Geologic Survey's site for sinkhole reports in the area of the building's address on Collins Avenue yields no results. Unlike Miami, which is more prone to sinkholes, Miami Beach is an area where the FGS says \"sinkholes are few, shallow, of small diameter and develop gradually.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no reason for this building to go down like that, unless someone literally pulls out the supports from underneath, or they get washed out, or there's a sinkhole or something like that, because it just went down,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said at a news conference Thursday morning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another Surfside official, Commissioner Eliana R. Salzhauer, also questioned whether the land underneath the building had been compromised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think this is all tied to sea-level rise and our overdevelopment,\" she said. \"And Mother Earth comes back, and the ocean comes back, and takes it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miami has also long suffered from \"king tides,\" higher-than-normal tides caused by alignments of the sun and moon that have been exacerbated by rising sea levels from melting glaciers and polar ice. These tides, which tend to be strongest in the fall, have routinely caused flooding in the city.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Army Corps of Engineers recently proposed a $6 billion sea wall up to 20 feet high running six miles along the coast to protect against storm surge. It would not cover Surfside, nor would it protect from tidal flooding elsewhere in the city.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tim Craig contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

They express skepticism about the feasibility of implementing a carbon tax due to political stalemate.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Friday's New York Times, four former chiefs of the Environmental Protection Agency, each of whom served Republican presidents, pointed out that taxing carbon dioxide emissions is the best way to respond to global warming on a national level. The GOP House of Representatives didn't take much time to reject their advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic facts,\" the former EPA heads wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our world continues to warm, with the last decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean warming faster than the earth's atmosphere. Sea level is rising. Arctic Sea ice is melting years faster than projected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of scientific evidence grow only stronger and more numerous. And the window of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay could mean that warming becomes \"locked in.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of responding with command-and-control rulemaking in which government reorders the economy by regulatory fiat, they point out, Congress should marshal the power of the market in the battle against climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Make people pay something for the emissions for which they are responsible, and you will get fewer emissions when and where consumers and businesses decide they are worth cutting. No command; no control. And the government could limit the effects on individual consumers and the general economy by rebating the revenues back to them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's just one problem: \"That is unachievable in the current political gridlock in Washington.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As if to drive that point home, the House on Friday morning passed a measure that would require Congress's approval for any carbon-taxing scheme that President Obama might try to impose by regulation, even though the White House has said it has no plans to propose one. More than anything, the symbolic vote seemed to be about trying to associate Democrats with a policy that has been a big target of GOP demagoguery, no matter how many outside experts say it's a good idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Friday's Times op-ed reminds us, there used to be a strong element in the Republican Party that was able to advocate for economically literate environmental policy. George H.W. Bush, after all, was the president who introduced market-based environmentalism into federal law, enacting a very-successful cap-and-trade program to combat acid rain. Now, the GOP's approach to the environment is dominated by those who go out of their way to repudiate good policy, use it as a political weapon, or both at the same time.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

The pact between the rivals, which are the world\u2019s two biggest polluters, surprised delegates to the summit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the agreement was short on specifics. China did not commit to a new timetable for reducing emissions, nor did it set a ceiling for how much its emissions would rise before they started to fall. And while China agreed to \u201cphase down\u201d coal starting in 2026, it did not specify by how much or over what period of time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Deforestation</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed to end deforestation by 2030. The landmark agreement covers about 85 percent of the world\u2019s forests, which are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twelve governments committed $12 billion, and private companies pledged $7 billion, to protect and restore forests in a variety of ways, including $1.7 billion for Indigenous peoples.

He\u2019s the California Climate Fellow for the Nature Conservancy, a researcher, and the expert behind the Weather West blog.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I initially wanted to talk to Mr. Swain about wildfires \u2014 their increasing severity and frequency \u2014 but, he explained, fire and rain and floods are part of climate cycles that are becoming more extreme.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe average condition doesn\u2019t characterize what you experience,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Average temperatures are rising, he said, and what\u2019s starting to become clear is that \u201cthe impacts of those warming temperatures are not incremental in living systems.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An average over years doesn\u2019t capture the real effects of a devastating drought and wildfires followed closely by a particularly wet rainy season on environments and communities, which are increasingly being built into wilderness areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, Mr. Swain said, Californians end up dealing with \u201cthe worst of both worlds.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question then becomes: How do you manage land use to minimize harm from extreme weather? Is it possible to store water when it rains and save it for when the state is wracked with drought?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be simple to, say, return it all to its natural state. Rip out the concrete in the Los Angeles River, let wildfires burn what they will, never allow construction where there\u2019s any risk of disaster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Swain said it\u2019s impossible to ignore the presence of humans or to discount the value of communities that have already been built \u2014 even if they coexist with the environment imperfectly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going forward, he said, there are opportunities to build more sustainably, and for policymakers to think carefully about managing things like groundwater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For now, though, Mr. Rowe, of the National Weather Service, said that another storm could be heading toward the Central Coast next week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re following</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was asked to weigh in on an issue Wednesday that hasn't really penetrated the 2020 presidential race to date: global population control. But his answer rekindles a decades-old debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During CNN's climate change town halls Wednesday night, a teacher named Martha Readyoff asked Sanders if he would support making population control part of his climate-change agenda. And Sanders said he would:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>READYOFF: Good evening. Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face. Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SANDERS: Well, Martha, the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that are \u2014 that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control, to me is totally absurd. So I think, especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies, and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, it's something I very, very strongly support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders's comments drew almost instant denunciations on the right. The Republican National Committee accused Sanders of saying he wanted to \"abort poor babies for population control.\" Conservative CNN host S.E. Cupp accused Sanders of supporting \"EUGENICS.\" Fox News's headline alleged that Sanders said \"he'd back US funding for Third World abortions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can say three things:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many of these critiques distort what Sanders actually said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy Sanders said he would reverse is something each of the past two Democratic presidents have reversed, so his position on it is hardly a surprise. And \u2026</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders talked about the issue in a way Democrats haven't generally talked about it, which should raise some eyebrows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \"Mexico City agreement\" is also known as the \"Mexico City policy\" or the \"global gag rule.\" It prohibits U.S. foreign aid not just directly for abortions, but for any organization that provides abortion or abortion-related services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason its name includes the Mexican capital is that it was introduced there in 1984 at a global conference on the threat of population growth. The Reagan administration caused a stir by introducing the policy and de-emphasizing the threat of overpopulation at a time when much of the world was quite concerned about the issue \u2014 hence the global conference, the first of which had been held in 1974.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, the rule has been a political football, predictably being passed back and forth depending on which party wins the White House. Bill Clinton reversed it in the early days of his administration in 1993. George W. Bush reinstated it shortly after his inauguration in 2001. Then Barack Obama pulled it back in 2009. Then President Trump put it back in place in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason all this might be news to people is that population growth has generally moved to the back burner as a political issue \u2014 and it's not often invoked in the U.S. climate change debate. Sanders seems to think it should be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in 1984, population growth was generally talked about as an economic and political threat \u2014 and less so an environmental one. \"Rapid population growth that outstrips a nation's resources and its economy's ability to produce jobs serves as a breeding ground for civil and political unrest,\" the New York Times's editorial board wrote in opposition to Reagan's 1984 policy. Even Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, had at a 1974 global conference endorsed family planning for developing nations to combat population growth \"that makes economic development more difficult.\" (Weinberger was then in the Nixon administration.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The population growth debate has largely subsided because early projections of the amount of growth and the coinciding disasters never really panned out. Invoking this in the context of the climate change debate risks accusations of overhype and alarmism \u2014 which are already the chief arguments against immediate action on climate change. Plus, as reaction to Sanders's response showed, abortion foes see an inherent link between population-control efforts and an uptick in abortions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sanders is hardly the first Democrat to attach the issue to environmental concerns. In his 1992 book, soon-to-be Vice President Al Gore wrote, \"No goal is more crucial to healing the global environment than stabilizing human population.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Democrats have also been careful to separate abortion from population control \u2014 instead arguing the Mexico City policy would hurt other efforts besides abortion, by defunding organizations that provide a variety of services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid a rift with the Vatican over his reversal of the policy, for example, Clinton in 1994 declared that \"the United States does not and will not support abortion as a means of birth control or population control.\" The line from the Obama administration was similar, given that Obama himself had campaigned on reducing abortions, even as he supported the right to one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's important to note that even reversing the Mexico City policy doesn't mean U.S. funds can go to funding abortions. Congress in 1974 banned the use of U.S. funds for abortion and abortion-related services, and that law remains on the books. The Mexico City policy simply expanded on that to prevent the funding of groups that provide such services \u2014 even if the money doesn't go directly to abortion services. It's similar to the debate over Planned Parenthood, which Republicans want to defund even though the federal funding it receives is already prohibited from being used for abortion services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders's 2016 campaign said he opposes that 1974 law, known as the Helms amendment. So it's fair to say that he supports federal funding for foreign abortion services. (Hillary Clinton did, too.) But saying he supports that policy in order to \"abort poor babies for population control\" is taking things to another level. One can support federal funding for abortions domestically, for instance, without believing it should be used specifically to stop population growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders did invoke abortion in his answer, but only in accurately describing what the Mexico City policy does. He also nodded generally to the idea that American women \"have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions\" as a key principal. But when describing specifically how he would support combating global population growth, Sanders only mentioned birth control. People may infer things from the fact that he invoked \"reproductive decisions\" in his answer, but he never said he thinks the United States should support abortion as a means of population control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, he's wading into an issue that is dicey. Despite its origins, the Mexico City policy isn't generally talked about in the context of population control these days, nor is population control as frequent a climate change topic as Gore seemed to regard it in 1992. Sanders's answer certainly invites more debate on how much of a priority this is for the Democratic Party \u2014 and what specifically should be done about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This post has been updated to clarify Sanders's position on the Helms amendment.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

We know that it is more efficient to prioritize resilience now, rather than to keep rebuilding,\" the president said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As examples, he pointed to plans to build resilient, permanent housing communities in \"safe zones\" that families living in temporary bunkhouses will eventually move to. Similarly, infrastructure--such as roads and bridges--will be rebuilt \"to withstand the onslaught of disasters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said the next year would be focused on rebuilding infrastructure and constructing temporary housing, while the entire restoration effort will take up to four years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Aquino said the government would help fortify the agriculture and fishing industries in the central Philippines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coral reefs were damaged, as well as freshwater fish and oyster ponds, boats and jetties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Nov. 8 typhoon, which killed more than 6,000 people and left more than three million people homeless, hammered the midsection of the country with winds of around 150 miles an hour. About 101,000 people are still living in nearly 400 government shelters. The typhoon destroyed more than 550,000 homes across several regions in the central Philippines--an area mainly devoted to agriculture and accounting for 12.7% of gross domestic product. Government economic managers have said damage from the typhoon could lower growth, although reconstruction spending should temper the storm's effects on the economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday visited one of the hardest-hit cities, Tacloban, where the U.S. will provide an additional $24.6 million to ensure typhoon victims have clean water, food and temporary shelter. That is in addition to $62 million that the U.S. has already committed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is devastation that is unlike anything I've seen at this kind of scale,\" Mr. Kerry said. \"It's many tornadoes that I have seen in America wrapped into one.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kerry also said Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola, both U.S. companies, would help more than 2,000 small stores repair, restock and reopen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Aquino made another pitch to international donors to contribute to the nearly $8.2 billion the Philippines needs for short- and medium-term recovery and reconstruction. So far, the government said almost $520 million has been pledged in foreign aid for relief efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report said the biggest expense will be reconstruction of housing, at $4.15 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Infrastructure sectors--such as electricity, roads, bridges and public buildings--will need nearly $640 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Josephine Cuneta\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Plastics are also being dumped into our Great Lakes at the rate of 22 million tons each year. They infiltrate our lives through water, air and soil and have serious consequences for human and animal health in addition to choking our environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Plastic, which is created from fossil fuels, also contributes to climate change at every step of its life cycle, from extraction to refinement, manufacture, transportation, disposal and waste. If plastic production and use grow as planned, by 2030 emissions from its production could reach 1.34 gigatons per year. That would be equivalent to the emissions released by some 295 new 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants. Plastics and climate change are a dual challenge to our well-being on our planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Help is on the way, but we as citizens must act. Congress has an opportunity to address the climate crisis and the plastic pollution crisis by passing the new Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2021, which builds on state laws across the country and outlines plastic reduction strategies that place the onus on the fossil fuel industry and plastic producers to realize a healthier and more sustainable future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Chicago Coalition for Plastic Reduction strongly urges our lawmakers in Washington to co-sponsor the pollution act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Jon Schmidt, Coalition for Plastic Reduction, Chicago</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bring US troops home</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since 2000, we have lost about 7,000 U.S. military members in Iraq and Afghanistan and have spent (directly and through budgetary obligations) $6.4 trillion on post-9/11 conflicts in areas of the world that do not like us, do not respect us and only want us to help prop up governments that can't stand on their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can stay there, and our opponents will slowly bleed us of personnel and dollars.

Small island states like the Maldives, facing an imminent threat from rising seas, want all countries to slash emissions as fast as possible. Oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia are not eager to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. And big developing countries like India are holding out for more help to shift to cleaner energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our team in Glasgow will be covering the talks live for the rest of the week. You can follow the Wednesday sessions here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The numbers: One of the main goals at the climate conference is a global pact to keep the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists say, the likelihood of deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and biodiversity collapse rises sharply. The planet has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trust, but verify: Satellites could be used to help determine whether nations are keeping their greenhouse gas pledges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A deal to phase out gasoline cars</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least six major automakers and more than two dozen national governments pledged on Wednesday to work toward phasing out sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 worldwide and by 2035 in \u201cleading markets.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The automakers who signed the pledge included Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Volvo. Together, they accounted for roughly one-quarter of global sales in 2019.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHaving these major players making these commitments, though we need to make sure that they follow through, is really significant,\u201d said Margo Oge, a former senior U.S. air quality official who now advises both environmental groups and auto companies. \u201cIt really tells us that these companies, and their boards, accept that the future is electric.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why it matters: Transportation accounts for roughly one-fifth of humanity\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions, with a little less than half of that coming from passenger vehicles like cars and vans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States did not join: Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said the Biden administration was \u201cfocused on what we are doing at home.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Looking to the future: Rivian, a maker of electric trucks and vans, is going public and has set a stock price that values the company at nearly $70 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Join us in Glasgow</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New York Times Climate Hub is still going strong on the sidelines of the U.N. climate conference.

Fewer than 10 were women. Their median age was over 60.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first week of the talks ended with boisterous protests of thousands on the streets of Glasgow. A march on Friday was led by young climate activists, most of them women and some barely old enough to vote in their countries. They accused the world leaders of wasting what little time remains to safeguard their future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those bookends to the first week of the talks revealed a widening divide that threatens to grow larger in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Video: More than 100,000 demonstrators marched in Glasgow, according to protest organizers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The numbers: Leaders at the summit are setting goals for 2030 at the earliest.

That\u2019s one of the big questions at COP26. A swift transition to renewable energy is crucial in the global fight against climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not only would that be particularly costly in poorer nations, many African countries have an abundance of natural gas or other fossil fuels. Plus, Sub-Saharan Africa contributes about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, among the lowest of the world\u2019s regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAfrican countries are the ones on the receiving end of this problem.

Some scientists speculate solar activity may decline further in the coming decades. Could a quieting sun cause the climate to cool enough to stall or even reverse global warming from the build-up of greenhouse gases? Leading climate scientists say no, the effect of the sun is too small.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every 11-year solar cycle is different, exhibiting stronger or weaker peaks and valleys. These variations have implications for climate and weather which researchers are trying to better understand. The general thinking is that less sunspot activity imparts a slight cooling effect on the climate but with significant regional differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sinking number of sunspots (at the solar max) in recent decades has some solar scientists wondering: are we heading towards a state of solar quiescence not seen since the famed Maunder Minimum of the mid-1600s to the early 1700s? That historic low point in sunspot activity coincided with the heart of Little Ice Age which featured bitter cold winters in North America and Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Indeed, the sun could be on the threshold of a mini-Maunder event right now,\" NASA said last month. \"Ongoing Solar Cycle 24 is the weakest in more than 50 years. Moreover, there is (controversial) evidence of a long-term weakening trend in the magnetic field strength of sunspots.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Judith Lean, a climate and solar scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory, said if we're headed towards a Maunder Minimum-type event, its arrival is hardly imminent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I doubt that we are on the threshold of a Maunder Minimum event right now (as in, the next decade),\" Lean said in an email. \"The current modern maximum has indeed likely peaked, but the growth in activity from the Maunder Minimum (1634-1715) to the modern maximum (1976-1996) took a few centuries. So if solar activity is indeed in decline it will, I suppose, take a few centuries to reach a Maunder Minimum type event.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lean stressed forecasts of the sun's activity are fraught with uncertainty and in their infancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't know what the sun will do - no one does because forecasting future solar activity even one solar cycle ahead is not at all reliable,\" Lean said. \"You may recall that initial forecasts for solar cycle 24 (our current cycle) were that it would be stronger than cycle 23 (which peaked around 2000-2002) whereas we are now probably near the peak of cycle 24 and it is very modest - weaker than 3 prior cycles.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's assume solar activity does drop in the coming decades. What might that mean for climate?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Mann, professor of climate science at Penn State University, said the effect of the 11-year solar cycle on climate is small.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Studies that have looked at the longer-term impact of a potential 21st century grand solar minimum have found that the [temperature] response would be dwarfed by anthropogenic [manmade] warming [from the build-up of greenhouse gas concentrations],\" Mann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, a recent study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters (Feulner and Rahmstorf, 2010) concluded a minimum in solar activity would shave just 0.3 degrees C off projected warming by 2100.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For her part, Lean agreed with the results of this study and with Mann.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Given our current understanding of how the sun varies and how climate responds, were the sun to enter a new Maunder Minimum, it would not mean a new Little Ice Age - it would simply slow down the current warming by a modest amount,\" Lean said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While these scientists see just a minor impact on the average global temperature from a possible solar minimum, the effects on regional climate may be more profound, though incompletely understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A recent report from the National Research Council (NRC) \"The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate\" finds small variations in solar output can have \"major influence\" on climate, particularly at the regional scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an example of the sun's possible effects on regional climate, consider the 2011 study in Nature Geoscience \"Solar forcing of winter climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere\" which found low solar activity is associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A negative NAO often results in cold, snowy conditions in eastern North American and northern Europe in winter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related: Has the sun driven recent precipitation extremes in Northeast?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists say more research is needed to understand the possible effects of the sun's evolving behavior on climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the sun really is entering an unfamiliar phase of the solar cycle, then we must redouble our efforts to understand the sun-climate link,\" said Lika Guhathakurta of NASA's Living with a Star Program, which helped fund the NRC study.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

But is it possible?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To slow extinctions and climate change, President-elect Joe Biden has embraced a plan to conserve 30 percent of U.S. land and 30 percent of its ocean waters by 2030. It is perhaps the most ambitious commitment to conservation by a U.S. president. How he proceeds will determine whether he unites or further divides Americans in a pivotal decade for the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plan is known as \u201c30 by 30.\u201d Behind the catchy phrase is a simple, scientifically informed belief that conserving 30 percent of the planet\u2019s land and 30 percent of its water is required to protect roughly 75 percent of Earth\u2019s species and slow climate change by storing carbon in plants and soil. In the words of a former interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, 30 by 30 is \u201ca kind of synthesizing, consolidating, organizing possibility.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twenty-six percent of U.S. ocean waters are now protected consistent with the goals of 30 by 30, but only 12 percent of the land. The goal of conserving 18 percent more of the land within this decade means protecting an area more than twice the size of Texas. It is an enormous challenge and requires carefully assembling a patchwork of not only public but also private land. Still, there are ways to do it that can draw different interests together toward a common goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many difficult questions must now be answered: Which places should we conserve? What do we count as \u201cconserved?\u201d How do we conserve it? And who decides?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The quickest path for the United States to reach its 30 percent land goal would rely on Mr. Biden\u2019s executive powers to increase the protection of federal lands by designating new national monuments and banning drilling, mining and timber harvesting. But most of the country\u2019s biodiversity and potential to store carbon are not on federal lands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About two-thirds of species on the Endangered Species List exist mainly on private land. More than half of the country\u2019s forests \u2014 critical carbon sinks, places that absorb more carbon dioxide than they release \u2014 are privately owned. Private lands also connect our public lands, providing seasonal habitat for wide-ranging wildlife and clean drinking water, crop pollination and flood control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Top-down declarations and land-use restrictions from Washington risk alienating rural Americans who otherwise support healthy lands, waters and wildlife. Instead of taking shortcuts to protect federal lands in ways that could antagonize nearby communities, the administration should work with state, local and tribal governments and the private sector to build on proven models of landscape conservation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, protecting land meant setting it aside as wilderness. But scientists increasingly view this approach alone as too narrow and rigid. Indigenous scholars have shown that many areas we now call wilderness were shaped over thousands of years by human activities. And the science on how ecosystems respond to climate change shows that they will move, shrink and grow. Modern conservation strategies avoid isolating ecosystems within hard boundaries and instead seek to connect tracts of land with diverse histories of protection and ownership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ideally, existing or newly protected public lands can link to surrounding private lands. One important tool is the conservation easement, a legal contract that allows for tax breaks or payments to landowners who give up development rights. But forgoing development forever is too great a commitment for many landowners. Other tools include some federal agricultural programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Program, which pay landowners annually to set aside sensitive habitats. The problem is that these incentives provide little long-term security against development.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Achieving 30 by 30 on private lands will require the durability of easements and the flexibility of short-term incentive programs. One such approach could be conservation leases with terms of 20 to 30 years that are palatable to landowners while providing meaningful protection. These programs would be less expensive than land purchases or easements, providing new ways for corporations and philanthropists to underwrite land protection at a scale much greater than can be achieved through the outright purchase of land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Biden administration can find many useful models of large landscape conservation encompassing both public and private lands. In the East, America\u2019s Longleaf Initiative, a coalition of government agencies, nonprofits and corporate and family forest owners, is restoring the longleaf pine ecosystem that once extended from Texas to Florida and north to Virginia. Since 2007 this work has driven an extraordinary recovery of the longleaf pine ecosystem to 4.7 million acres from 3.4 million acres.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the West, the Agriculture Department\u2019s Sage Grouse Initiative has secured easements on nearly 700,000 acres of private land across 11 Western states \u2014 including areas of Wyoming and Montana that are part of the world\u2019s longest-known mule deer and pronghorn migrations. This initiative has increased sage grouse nesting and foraging habitat on a further seven million acres by working with ranchers to restore grasslands, streams and wetlands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans generally support land conservation, but differ over how it should be carried out. A survey published this year by Duke University suggests that while rural Americans care deeply about conservation, they do not trust big environmental groups like those that have pushed 30 by 30. Instead, they prefer policies overseen by state and local governments that foster collaboration with communities. A failure to engage rural Americans is the fastest way to ensure collapse of 30 by 30.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration must also recognize the violence, displacement and marginalization that have often accompanied land conservation. Native Americans and other peoples of color have been largely excluded from U.S. conservation policy, and many of them, living in cities, view public lands as remote and unwelcoming. A successful 30 by 30 strategy must encompass needs as diverse as tribal priorities and urban green spaces in historically excluded communities. Mr. Biden signaled a commitment to environmental justice last week when he said he would nominate Deb Haaland, a congressional representative from New Mexico and a Native American, to lead the Interior Department, which manages more than 440 million acres of federal land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where does the Biden White House begin? The administration should move quickly to develop a science-based plan and lay out an inclusive process. At the same time, the sheer scale of the vision will require taking the time to coordinate across the entire federal government and with state, local and tribal governments. With careful planning, the Biden administration can ensure that 30 by 30 doesn\u2019t die as a fleeting national aspiration, but sets the course for a truly inclusive conservation vision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arthur Middleton and Justin Brashares are professors in the department of environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Unnerved and fearful? Something big and bad and existential seems like it's coming down the pike and you can't quite put your finger on it?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse yet, feeling a little bit ... complicit?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does the Chicago Public Library have a book for you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 2019 selection for its One Book, One Chicago cross-city reading initiative is the tremendous (and tremendously scary) \"The Sixth Extinction\" (Henry Holt 2014), New Yorker staff writer Elizabeth Kolbert's 2014 tour de force history about mass species die-offs and the overwhelming evidence that we are currently living through such a period of steep, probably irreversible decline. She visits the last stand for frogs in South America and the caves in Vermont that are littered with the bodies of bats succumbing to a mysterious disease. As the Tribune review said at the time: \"It's not exactly a whodunit.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We shuttle invasive species around the globe and lean on fossil fuels.Last week, the Trump administration announced an end to energy-saving light-bulb initiatives, and just before that, the dismantling of the Endangered Species Act. On the surface of Lake Michigan, record water levels are swamping beaches and concrete walls; beneath the water, invasive mussels carpet the lake. Insects are going extinct faster than we can keep up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CPL, as it has for all its One Book, One Chicago selections for the past 18 years, is planning related events from October through February -- including an excellent-sounding speaker series with Dan Egan (\"The Death and Life of the Great Lakes\"), David Wallace-Wells (\"The Uninhabitable Earth\") and Kolbert herself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But frankly, read \"The Sixth Extinction\" and you wonder if there'll be a fall -- or a winter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a statement about the new book selection, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said, \"Climate change is not only a fact, it is among the most urgent and dire global crises we face. Through studying this important subject, we will not only help educate our young readers of this reality, but also inspire them to do something about it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only Kolbert felt that way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From her home in the Berkshires (where she is working on another environmental book), Kolbert said that Chicago is not the first city to choose \"The Sixth Extinction\" for its all-city reading initiative, but it is the largest. She also said that, in the five years since the book was released, \"to be as objective as possible, some things (discussed in the book) are irreversible -- if you're extinct, it's hard to change that -- and some things will be harder to fix now. We will be leaving our kids with a seriously different planet and some of that trajectory we can't alter. Some say 'Don't give up!' and some want to say 'Give up,' but the truth is that neither of (those views) feels entirely accurate or realistic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked if the speed of environmental change (and lack of coherent government policy) has rendered the book outdated since publication, she said no, that \"if anything it's been born out by the events of the last five years. Every day you click on a story or open the paper and find more evidence that something serious is happening.

Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cIf the question is, \u2018Could this move us along the path we want to be on?\u2019 the answer is yes, it could.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his speech, Mr. Obama said he would use executive powers to limit the carbon dioxide that power plants could emit. He also called for government spending to promote the development of energy alternatives, and committed to helping cities and states protect themselves from rising seas and other effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But formally, the main thing he did on Tuesday was order the Environmental Protection Agency to devise an emissions control plan, with the first draft due in a year. Experts say he will be lucky to get a final plan in place by the time he leaves office in early 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama is trying to ensure continuation of a trend already under way: emissions in the United States have been falling for several years. But at the global scale, they are rising fast, and as the president acknowledged, it will take much stronger international action to turn that around and head off the worst effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFor the world at large, the United States is just one piece of the puzzle,\u201d Mr. Levi said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, glaciers are melting, heat waves and heavy rains are increasing, the food system is under stress and the sea is rising. The best that can be hoped for, scientists say, is to limit the damage, or slow it enough to provide society more time to adjust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president recognized that in his plan, calling for more steps to help the country prepare, from strengthening sea walls to hardening the electrical grid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, however, is lowering the country\u2019s emissions using administrative remedies, an effort to sidestep a recalcitrant Congress. The success of that goal will depend on how far the administration is able to stretch the boundaries of the Clean Air Act, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court has already ruled that it can be used to regulate greenhouse gases, which include carbon dioxide emissions, but figuring out how to do that within the technical requirements of the law will be a major challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s thinking appears to have been influenced by a proposal from an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The group urged a creative approach, calling on the federal government to set a target level of greenhouse gases for each state, taking account of historical patterns. A state generating a lot of power from coal, then exporting it to other states, would not be unduly penalized, for instance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the environmental group envisions it, states would meet their goals by tweaking the overall electrical system, not just by cracking down on individual power plants. States might urge companies to produce more renewable power, for instance, but they could also retrofit homes and businesses to reduce energy waste, or encourage the use of clean-burning natural gas instead of coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States would presumably be allowed to use market signals, like a price on greenhouse emissions, to achieve their goals, as California and nine Northeastern states are already doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is unclear how much all this might cost at the retail level. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that even if prices go up, electric bills for many consumers could actually decline as their homes were retrofitted to use less energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fossil-fuel industry and its allies in Congress are certain to argue that the president\u2019s plan will be ruinously expensive and require the shutdown of numerous coal-burning power plants. Republican leaders immediately condemned the plan as a job-killer and framed it as an attack on coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The political attraction of a state-led approach is that it would move a lot of the nitty-gritty decision making out of Washington. But, for that very reason, it would entail legal risk. The Clean Air Act, written in the heyday of environmentalism, basically envisions commandments from Washington ordering utilities to clean up the air, not flexible approaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere reached a historic level of 400 parts per million last month, emissions from the United States have been falling, partly because of the weak economy but also because of the newfound abundance of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing. Gas has displaced a lot of coal in power generation; such switching cuts greenhouse emissions nearly in half for a given amount of electricity produced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other factors, like tougher building codes, are contributing to the decline. And transport emissions are falling in part because of one of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies: tough fuel-efficiency measures for new cars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But modest reductions already achieved in the United States and other Western countries are being swamped by rising emissions from the East. So the real question is whether technologies can be developed, and then deployed worldwide, that allow for continued economic growth and rising energy use with minimal greenhouse emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his speech, Mr. Obama sought to reclaim global leadership on climate change for the United States. His plan includes ideas and money for making global progress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel P. Schrag, head of Harvard\u2019s Center for the Environment, said the president\u2019s plan would succeed only if it created market conditions unleashing the creative power of American capitalism, calling forth greater innovation in the energy industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama nodded to that point in his speech, noting that \u201ccountries like China and Germany are going all in\u201d on the clean energy race. \u201cI believe Americans build things better than anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cI want America to win that race, but we can\u2019t win it if we\u2019re not in it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John M.

And that's assuming politicians find the most efficient ways to reduce carbon emissions. \"If not, the real cost could double.\" Mr. Lomborg says that  at best the cuts \"will prevent a total temperature rise by 2100 of only 0.306 degrees Fahrenheit  .\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He adds  , \"The U.N.'s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, says openly that the aim of the talks is 'to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution.'\" But that model has worked pretty well  . \"For one, life expectancy in the past 150 years has more than doubled, to 71 years in 2013 from fewer than 30 years in 1870.\" Meanwhile, those living in extreme poverty now comprise less than 10% of the world's population, down from more than 75%   a century and a half ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our columnist Bret Stephens describes   the obscure Belgian town of Molenbeek that has become a breeding ground for Islamic terrorists, including at least one of the Paris attackers. \"For many years the mayor of Molenbeek was a man named Philippe Moureaux, a Socialist best known as the author of the 1981 Law Against Racism and Xenophobia. In 2004 he helped pass a law allowing noncitizens to vote in municipal elections. Roughly a quarter of Molenbeek's 96,000 residents are not Belgian citizens. Mr. Moureaux was also instrumental in engineering the political marriage of his Socialist Party with Muslim arrivals from Turkey and North Africa,\" writes Mr. Stephens  .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For college administrators struggling to respond to student protests, our columnist William McGurn suggests   a 1960s example of campus leadership. Notre Dame's Rev. Theodore Hesburgh \"recognized 'the validity of protest' but made clear that any group that 'substituted force for rational persuasion, be it violent or nonviolent,' would be given 15 minutes to meditate. Students who persisted would have their IDs confiscated and be 'suspended from this community.'\" Said Hesburgh,   \"I would like to insist here that all of us are responsible to the duly constituted laws of this University community and to all of the laws of the land. There is no other guarantee of civilization  versus the jungle or mob rule, here or elsewhere.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama is criticizing Americans who oppose accepting refugees from Syria. \"If Mr. Obama fought Islamic State with half the vigor with which he delivers moral lectures, he'd find that a much less fearful America would welcome far more refugees,\"says a Journal editorial  . Mr. Obama is \"especially harsh on those, like Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, who say Christian refugees should be a priority,\" writes the editorial board  . \"But Messrs. Bush and Cruz are right that Christians are under particular threat from Islamic State. If they aren't killed for jihadist sport, they must convert to Islam or die. Their daughters are raped and forced into Muslim marriages. Their churches are blown up. The U.S. would have been right to accept and save more Jews from Nazi genocide in the 1930s and 1940s. Syrian Christians are no different today  .\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A separate Journal editorial says   that in response to a question on ISIS at Saturday night's debate, Hillary Clinton's \"free association could not have been more substance-free  .\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editorial board also observes   that \"Japan is in recession for the fifth time in seven years, and the second time since Shinzo Abe returned to office three years ago.\" Mr. Abe has favored increased government spending and monetary expansion. \"The result is a national debt set to hit 250% of GDP by the end of the year. The Bank of Japan is buying bonds at a $652 billion annual rate, a more radical quantitative easing than the Federal Reserve's. Yet deflation continues because banks haven't increased lending.\" And needed deregulation hasn't occurred.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But quantitative easing in the U.S. has been radical enough to drive changes in the way Americans save for retirement. Michael Thompson of S&P Investment Advisory Services notes   that a \"recent report from Fidelity Investments found that 11% of its 401(k) account holders aged 50-54 had a staggering 100% of their retirement assets invested in stocks.\" But \"with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields averaging 2.3% over the past five years, retirement-age investors have had few alternatives.\" As a result, says Mr. Thompson,   his firm estimates \"roughly $1.3 trillion in retiree assets are currently misallocated into equities based on the historic 16-year average price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By James Freeman\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Researchers found a 27-fold increase over the past decade in the number of people experiencing an \u201cextreme smoke day,\u201d which is defined as air quality deemed unhealthy for all age groups. In 2020 alone, nearly 25 million people across the contiguous United States were affected by dangerous smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the growing threats posed by fire have been explored in detail, particularly for populations in the most fire-prone regions, the risks that smoke pollution pose have been stymied by lack of precise data until now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cPeople may be less likely to notice days with a modest increase in fine particulate matter from smoke, but those days can still have an impact on people\u2019s health,\u201d said Marissa Childs, who led the research while getting her Ph.D from Stanford. She also noted that the most extreme smoke days were rarely seen between 2006 to 2010. But in the more recent study years, from 2016 to 2020, she said the research shows that more than 1.5 million people, particularly in the Western United States, were routinely exposed to levels that carry immediate risks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Childs, currently a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Center for the Environment and School of Public Health, had originally intended to focus on the health effects of fire-related air pollution. \u201cWhen we started, we realized there were a lot of questions about how smoke affected people\u2019s health that we didn\u2019t have answers to,\u201d she said, including basic questions around estimated mortality from smoke fine particulate matter, and how the health effects of smoke compare with other sources of pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Filling in that gap was a long and arduous process. The analysis began with satellite data to map the geographic spread of particulate matter from above, and incorporated ground-level monitors to measure pollution where it matters most to human health. The research isolated wildfire smoke from background pollution from other sources, which has actually decreased in recent decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe have been remarkably successful in cleaning up other sources of air pollution across the country, mainly due to regulation like the Clean Air Act,\u201d said Marshall Burke, a co-author of the research and professor of earth system science at Stanford. \u201cThat success, especially in the West, has really stagnated. And in recent years this started to reverse.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The research indicates that wildfire smoke is a leading cause of that reversal, wiping out most of the progress. Some areas in the Western United States had increases in particulate pollution from smoke that were about the same amount as the improvements in air quality from regulating factories and other point-source pollution. As climate change intensifies fire risk across the country and smoke plumes can travel thousands of miles from their source, no one is safe from the effects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Particulate pollution causes more than short-term irritation. It has been linked to chronic heart and lung conditions, as well other negative health effects like cognitive decline, depression and premature birth. But more work remains to be done on pollution specifically from wildfires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is no safe concentration,\u201d said Tarik Benmarhnia, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego, who contributed to an earlier study on hospitalizations showing that smoke from wildfires can be 10 times more harmful than other sources of air pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, much of the existing research sees wildfires as something \u201crare, exceptional and intense,\u201d according to Dr. Benmarhnia. But in a changing climate, he sees the health impacts of chronic exposure as one of the biggest questions to answer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Subsequent research with this data will have important policy implications, both for local governments at the source of wildfires and for wider populations affected by smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One solution, experts say, is to reduce the potential for wildfires to grow into long-lasting and destructive infernos. In recent years, California has recognized that decades of fire suppression have led to a build-up of fuel in forests where smaller, contained fires actually contribute to the health of the forest. The state has been increasing prescribed fires and other forest management techniques to help reduce the risk of out-of-control megafires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new research indicates that the health risk is rising as the hot and dry conditions for wildfires continue to worsen with climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And existing warning systems won\u2019t be enough in the future. \u201cWe can\u2019t just ask people to stay inside half the year,\u201d said Dr. Benmarhnia. \u201cAt the end of the day, the best type of policy is to proactively prevent these big fires in the first place.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Just when you thought you couldn't take any more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finding out that 1 million species face extinction without radical corrective changes in human behavior is akin to finding out you have a fatal disease. One day you have a thousand problems; the next, you have just one. Nothing in today's headlines compares to the catastrophic potential posed by climate change and the decimating effects of careless consumerism around the globe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The four horsemen of the apocalypse \u2014 generally considered to be conquest, war, famine and death \u2014 weren't far off the mark. Today, we might revise the New Testament version to include plastics, emissions, deforestation and Homo sapiens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lest some folks become incensed by this apparent disparagement of man's great works (see war and conquest), be assured that such evidence is everywhere abundant and noted. But men and women who can create plastic (my own great-uncle, a chemist, played a part) can surely find biodegradable \u2014 and profitable \u2014 alternatives. Dustin Hoffman may not don flippers and scuba gear to unwillingly celebrate the future of plastics, as famously portrayed in \"The Graduate,\" but perhaps a young congresswoman from the Bronx will lead a confetti parade driving a cardboard convertible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's time to change our habits and, pending a better cliche, save the planet. It's dying, and we'll die with it, eventually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report, a summary of which was released Monday by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), was the result of a three-year study by 145 authors from 50 countries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robert Watson, a British chemist who served as chair of the panel, wrote in a statement that \"the health of ecosystems on which we and all species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, Watson also said, it's not too late to repair and sustain nature \u2014 if we act now in transformative ways. It won't be enough for us to recycle our Dasani bottles or tote our own shopping bags, though these are helpful and keep us mindful. But big companies have to sign on, and governments have to create incentives and policies to advance sweeping change. Needless to say, this won't be easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In certain quarters, resistance to policy and procedures will be seized upon as a noble counter to regulatory zeal. Already, some so-called \nconservatives\nare gearing up to treat the report as a globalist attempt to hinder the United States' return to greatness via more burning of fossil fuels, drilling for oil offshore and declassifying conservation areas. But conservatives by definition should lead the imperative. To conserve what is good \u2014 isn't that the point?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report makes the essential connection to human wellness, as opposed to merely caring about the horrors endured by sea creatures dying with their stomachs packed with plastic or Arctic animals starving to death as the ground melts beneath their feet. If something hurts economies and schoolchildren, we eventually get around to paying attention. As Watson \nnoted, \"We need to link it to human well-being; that's the crucial thing. Otherwise we're going to look like a bunch of tree-huggers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only there were enough trees to go around.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's clear is that there's no time for delay or partisan bickering. What's different now is the degree of acceleration. Everything is speeding up, including the temperature and acidification of oceans, which contribute to the loss of coral reefs, themselves underwater ecosystems essential to more than 25 percent of marine species.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the world's population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by mid-century, according to the United Nations. Already, it has tripled since 1950. Collectively, we humans have altered 75 percent of Earth's land and more than half of the marine environment. More people require more crops, more land  and fewer trees, which ultimately results in warmer temperatures \u2014 and you know the rest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Who knows?

Are you surprised the margin wasn\u2019t wider given that Cuccinelli had expressed wildly right-wing views on issues ranging from climate change to abortion, leading to a campaign that forced voters to mull their views on global warming, sodomy and transvaginal ultrasounds?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or are you amazed that the Democrats won this one at all, with a candidate who admitted \u2014 practically bragged \u2014 that while driving his newborn son home from the hospital, he stopped to make a 15-minute appearance at a political fund-raiser while infant and weeping wife sat in the car?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI felt bad for Dorothy, but it was a million bucks for the Democratic Party,\u201d McAuliffe said in his autobiography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honestly, it was a miracle anybody in Virginia showed up to vote. I did like Cuccinelli\u2019s breakout attack theme: \u201cAll puppy and no plan.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that one resurfaces during the presidential race. Which is just around the corner, presuming the corner lasts for 26 months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential! That brings us back to Chris Christie, the man of the hour. Even though he\u2019s a Republican in a deep blue state, he won a huge victory against \u2014 um, the Democrat. Who was ... named ... Barbara Buono.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Buono was battling odds that made the Alamo look like a quick game of Parcheesi. She\u2019s a 20-year veteran of the State Legislature, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that always inspires excitement among the electorate. She had about a quarter of Christie\u2019s budget for ads. Nobody from the Clinton family went to New Jersey to campaign for her. Some days, it seemed as if nobody from New Jersey was showing up, either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe Democratic political bosses ... made a deal with this governor, despite him representing almost everything they\u2019re against. They didn\u2019t do it for the state. They did it to help themselves politically and financially,\u201d Buono said on election night, in a speech that centered on the terribleness of her own state party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a place that\u2019s dominated by one political party, like New Jersey, the electorate often picks somebody from the other side to be governor, in hopes that he or she will keep a lid on things. Christie is sort of a larger and louder version of New York\u2019s George Pataki, who I believe has been in New Hampshire trying to drum up presidential primary interest since 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Christie sees himself as a scrappy guy fighting against impossible odds, but he\u2019s actually been wildly lucky. Politically, he\u2019s in a perfect position. To his left, the New Jersey State Legislature and the county bosses. To his right, the crazy national Republican Party. He gets everything in between!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe people of New Jersey rewarded me last night for the personal relationship that we have,\u201d he told a press conference on Wednesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Christie has been suggesting, very, very frequently, that his success is all about personality. That certainly makes sense, since his major actual achievement as governor was to get everyone to agree on a plan to bail out the public employee pension fund ... soon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is he the tough-talking truth-teller the nation is yearning for? Critics in New Jersey say the governor\u2019s main administrative talent is for balancing a budget with imaginary revenues. But even if Christie was really the candidate he claims to be, we\u2019re not the electorate we imagine we are. Who was the last person to get to the White House without a public persona that was smooth and affable? Richard Nixon? Harry Truman? I hear John Adams was kind of prickly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Could Christie survive a presidential race when he couldn\u2019t even get past the Mitt Romney vice presidential vetting process? There\u2019s all that stuff about exploding expense accounts and his prior career as a lobbyist for the securities industry. True, the people of New Jersey have looked into his past and come away satisfied. But, really, in New Jersey you\u2019re just happy to know a candidate is not currently under indictment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have so much to discuss. Thank God we\u2019ve got 790 more days until the Iowa caucuses.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Many take direct aim at the decisions of former President Donald Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden also spoke with foreign leaders like Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to reinstate a relationship between the two countries and speak on shared challenges like tackling climate change and the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here are some actions Biden took during his first week as president of the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s latest executive orders</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prioritizing climate change and the environmental policy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden signed a series of executive orders Wednesday to combat climate change. The three orders focus on an array of climate and environmental justice-related measures such as focusing on infrastructure needs and prioritizing scientific research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The orders elevate climate change as a national security concern and paves the way for the re-establishment of the president\u2019s council of advisors of science and technology.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Poll: Americans want Congress to cooperate with Biden, view his agenda positively</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, Biden also signed an order to halt construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is set to pass through the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana and the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The administration also suspended new drilling permits on federal land and waters for 60 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his first day in office, Biden also had the United States rejoin the Paris Agreement, an international treaty focused on climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and other environment-related policy, reversing Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the agreement in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans have denounced Biden\u2019s policies, saying his climate policies are too expensive and can eliminate oil and gas jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, Biden launched the $700 billion Buy American campaign, which encourages the federal government to buy more American-made products.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This effort, which the president states \u201cwill help American businesses compete in strategic industries and help America\u2019s workers thrive\u201d, also calls on the director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish a Made in America office and appoint a made in America director who will head the office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration argues that this effort will further stimulate the U.S. economy, which has struggled during the pandemic. The unemployment rate in the U.S. was 6.7% in December and employers cut about 140,000 jobs, according to the Department of Labor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, Biden also laid out the foundation to raise the minimum wage to $15 and restored collective bargaining power and worker protections for federal workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt is the policy of the United States to protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce \u2026 The Federal Government should serve as a model employer,\u201d the executive order states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another executive order calls on federal agencies and departments to \u201cprioritize actions that provide the greatest relief to individuals, families, and small businesses; and to State, local, tribal, and territorial governments.\u201d Biden specifically asks federal agencies to improve accessibility or reduce unnecessary barriers to programs that can help struggling Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During his first day on the job, the president also signed an executive order to extend the nationwide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures until March 31. Additionally, Biden extended the pause on student federal loan payments and interest to Sept. 30.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration reform</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after his victory, the president promised Americans he would work to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s strict policies on immigration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden issued several immigration-related executive orders on day one. He reinstated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era program that shielded undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump reversed the program in 2017, sending it through layers of litigation. Biden also sent his immigration reform plan to Congress, which outlines a path to permanent residence and citizenship for DACA beneficiaries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's proposal was met with clear opposition from several GOP members of Congress like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McConnell called the plan \"a massive proposal for blanket amnesty that would gut enforcement of American laws while creating huge new incentives for people to rush here illegally at the same time,\" according to NBC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undocumented immigrants will now also be counted as a part of the U.S. census, which takes place every 10 years, per another executive order. Biden also revoked an executive order issued by Trump in 2017 that cracked down on communities shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cImmigrants have helped strengthen America\u2019s families, communities, businesses and workforce, and economy, infusing the United States with creativity, energy, and ingenuity,\u201d the president wrote in the executive order.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to targeting policies related to undocumented immigrants, Biden reversed Trump\u2019s policy that forbid refugees and residents from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. The order also states the Secretary of State must resume visa processing within the next 45 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden also terminated the construction of the widely controversial border wall at the U.S.-Mexico southern border and will direct a review of the resources and funds that were redirected to build the wall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Promoting equity and diversity</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden tackled the issues of housing discrimination and equity on Tuesday after issuing executive orders directing his administration to address racial bias in housing programs and terminate the government\u2019s use of private prisons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also recently reversed Trump\u2019s transgender ban in the military with an executive order stating all Americans, regardless of gender identity, can serve in the military. Similarly, Biden also extended federal nondiscrimination protections to members of the LGBTQ+ community</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cEvery person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love,\u201d Biden wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COVID-19 safety measures</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Upon assuming office, Biden began to roll out several COVID-19 safety measures and policy proposals. To date, the United States has seen over 400,000 deaths related to the coronavirus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s first measure as president was asking Americans to wear a mask for the first 100 days of his presidency as a part of the \u201c100 Days Masking Challenge.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden also issued an executive order requiring masks and social distancing in all federal buildings and on federal lands. Federal employees and contractors are also required to wear masks. The order also calls on the Department of Health and Human Services and the Center for Disease Control to work with state, local, tribal and territorial leaders to implement requirements for masking, social distancing and other safety measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Additionally, Biden issued another executive order requiring masks on several modes of transportation, including planes, trains, busses and ferries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also reversed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. The administration also vowed to work with WHO on \u201cCOVID-19 health and humanitarian response, and advance global health and health security.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A day after his assuming office, Biden issued an order calling for the improvement and expansion of access to healthcare and COVID-19 vaccines. To support the development of more treatments, the president is asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the director of the National Institutes of Health to craft a plan to support vaccine studies and research in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another order, Biden called on the heads of all executive departments and agencies to gather, share and publish data on the virus. The president also extended federal support to governors using the National Guard to respond to the impacts of the pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the pandemic continues to disrupt the academic and professional lives of thousands of Americans, the president issued two executive orders to ease the transition from online to in-person learning and enforcing the protection of essential workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first order, which states the president\u2019s support for re-opening schools, calls on the Secretary of Education to work with elementary and secondary schools on how to reopen and stay open. The order came as counties across the U.S. are debating reopening schools and the possible implications of doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Undoing Trump's policies and other things Biden did his first week as president\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

For the region, this period is now the driest two decades in 1,200 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crisis is particularly acute in Monterrey, one of Mexico's most important economic hubs and where the entire metropolitan area of about 5 million people is affected by drought, according to officials. Some neighborhoods in Monterrey have been without water for 75 days, leading many schools to close before the scheduled summer break.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The situation in the city has gotten so dire, a visiting journalist could not find any drinking water for sale at several stores, including a Walmart.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Buckets, too, are scarce at local stores -- or being sold at astronomically high prices -- as Monterrey's residents scrape together containers to collect water supplied by government trucks sent to the driest neighborhoods. Some residents clean out trash cans to ferry water home, children struggling to help carry what can amount to 450 pounds of water.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monterrey is in northern Mexico, the most parched region of the country, which has seen its population grow in recent years as the economy boomed. But the area's typically arid weather is struggling to support the population as climate change reduces what little rainfall the region has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monterrey's residents can now walk across the floor of the reservoir that was created by the Cerro Prieto Dam and was once one of the city's largest sources of water. The reservoir also used to be a major tourist attraction that the local government marketed for its lively waterfront restaurants and its fishing, boating and water-skiing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The amount of rain in July in parts of the state of Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas and whose capital is Monterrey, was just 10% of the monthly average recorded since 1960, according to Juan Ignacio Barragan Villarreal, the general director of the city's water agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In March it did not rain a single drop in the entire state,'' he said, adding that it was the first rain-free March since the government started keeping records in 1960.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now the government distributes about 2.38 million gallons of water daily to 400 neighborhoods. Every day large trucks filled with water and pipes for distribution fan out across Monterrey and its suburbs to tend to the needs of the driest neighborhoods, often illegal settlements that are home to the poorest residents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alejandro Casas, a water truck driver, said that when he started the job five years ago, he supported the city's firefighters and was called perhaps once or twice a month to deliver water to a fire scene.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he now works every day, making up to 10 daily trips to various neighborhoods to supply about 200 families with each trip.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time Casas arrives, a long queue snakes through neighborhood streets with people waiting their turn. Some families carry containers that can hold 53 gallons, and wait throughout the afternoon before finally receiving water at midnight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The water he delivers can be all the family gets for up to a week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one polices the lines, so fights break out as residents from other communities try to sneak in instead of waiting for trucks to reach their neighborhood days later.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May, Casas' truck was stormed by several young men who threatened him as he was delivering water to one neighborhood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They spoke to me with a very threatening tone,\" Casas said, explaining that they demanded he drive the truck to their neighborhood to distribute water. \"They told me that if we don't go to where they wanted, they were going to kidnap us.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Casas headed to the other neighborhood, filled residents' buckets and was set free.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maria De Los Angeles, 45, was born and raised in Cienega de Flores, a town near Monterrey. She says the water crisis is straining her family and her business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have never experienced a crisis like this before,\" De Los Angeles said. \"The water only comes through our taps every four or five days.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crisis, she said, is pushing her into bankruptcy -- a garden nursery she owns is her family's only source of livelihood and needs more water than can be provided by the occasional water that flows through her home's taps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have to buy a water tank every week that costs me 1,200 pesos,\" equal to $60, from a private supplier, she said. That consumes about half of her weekly income of $120.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Small-business owners like De Los Angeles are frustrated that they are left to fend for themselves while Monterrey's big industries are largely able to operate normally because of federal concessions that give them special access to the city's aquifers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To try to mitigate future shortages, the state is investing about $97 million to build a plant to treat wastewater and plans to buy water from a desalination plant under construction in a neighboring state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government has spent about $82 million to rent more trucks to distribute water, pay additional drivers and dig more wells, according to Barragan Villarreal, the general director of the water agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The governor of Nuevo Leon state, Samuel Garcia, recently urged the world to act together to tackle climate change because it was beyond the capacity of any single government to confront.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The climate crisis has caught up to us,\" Garcia wrote on Twitter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Today we have to take care of the environment, it is life or death.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAPTION: Photo: Residents line up to fill their containers with water on  June 21 in Monterrey, the second largest city in Mexico.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) laid out to voters here how she helped get $4 billion in the bill to combat the acute drought now punishing the American West. Outside the air-conditioned offices of the Las Vegas Valley Water District where she spoke, the temperature stood at 93 degrees \u2014 on its way to an oppressive 106 later that day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As you all know, the western U.S. continues to face a historic drought, and we need to do all we can to combat it,\" Cortez Masto said Monday, standing before a photo showing the nation's largest reservoir, Lake Mead, at record lows. \"That's why I have been championing measures to help Southern Nevada further conserve, recycle and reduce water use.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto \u2014 one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for reelection this year \u2014 has spent recent weeks courting Nevada voters who want leaders in Washington to prioritize the climate crisis. Yet climate change has rarely decided the outcome in congressional races, even in Las Vegas, the nation's second-fastest warming city in a region experiencing the most extreme drought in 1,200 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters across the country have consistently ranked the economy and health care as a higher priority than global warming. And if Democrats cannot successfully sell their environmental agenda in Nevada, which has seen a cascade of climate disasters this summer, it's unclear whether climate concerns will ever become paramount in key national races.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In interviews with more than a dozen voters in the working-class neighborhoods that encircle Las Vegas, most said they were focused on providing for their families amid soaring housing costs and gasoline prices. Few of them brought up climate change or were aware the Inflation Reduction Act provided drought relief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've been not buying a lot of things because I can't afford it,\" office worker Melissa Salinas said in an interview outside La Bonita, a Hispanic supermarket in northwest Las Vegas where a gallon of milk costs $4.99, above the national average. \"I'm like, 'The kids don't need juice for school anymore. We'll just do water.'\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Salinas was not familiar with the climate bill, she's worried enough about the drought that she and her family are considering relocating: \"We've looked into moving from here because it was just like, 'Where's the water going to come from?'\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The signs of climate change are everywhere in Nevada this year. Las Vegas reached a record daily high of 109 degrees on June 10 \u2014 so hot that sensors in space picked up the heat. And on the same day that Biden signed the climate bill into law, federal officials informed Nevada policymakers that they must cut the state's water use from the dwindling Colorado River by 8 percent, while National Park Service rangers discovered a fifth set of human remains in the receding waters of Lake Mead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto's GOP challenger, former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, has said little about the Western drought and supports oil and gas drilling, which is helping drive up global temperatures. He has criticized the Inflation Reduction Act, which no Republicans supported, as \"reckless\" spending that will \"fuel inflation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate package authorizes the biggest infusion of federal spending yet to tackle global warming \u2014 roughly $369 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below their 2005 levels by the end of this decade. Democrats have said the measure will reduce Americans' energy costs by providing tax credits for consumers to buy electric vehicles, install solar panels and embrace other climate-friendly technologies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill also sets aside $4 billion for drought mitigation, which will help conserve water in Lake Mead and Lake Powell and pay farmers who voluntarily reduce their water deliveries. Cortez Masto fought to include the drought funding along with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and two other Democratic senators facing tight reelection races: Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kelly, a former astronaut who has seen the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest from space, said in an interview that the drought money \"has little or nothing to do with the election\" and \"everything to do with\" preventing an environmental catastrophe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We can't allow the Colorado River to get down to dead pool,\" Kelly said, referring to when key reservoirs drop so low they would not be able to produce hydropower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Seven Western states in the Colorado River basin last week blew past a deadline to reach an agreement on making unprecedented cuts to their water use. The Bureau of Reclamation responded by announcing Arizona must reduce its water supply by 21 percent, Nevada by 8 percent and the country of Mexico by 7 percent. Larger cuts loom in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laxalt sent a statement on the drought to 8 News Now, a local news outlet, after initially declining to comment on the issue. He endorsed \"long-term solutions that take an all-of-the-above approach, including desalination in California and Arizona.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Big Oil and wildfires</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto has held several events focused on issues besides climate change, including a recent roundtable on how the Inflation Reduction Act will lower prescription drug costs for older Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In her first campaign ad of the general election, however, Cortez Masto accused Laxalt of being bankrolled by large oil and gas companies, a leading contributor to global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Where you find Big Oil, you'll find Adam Laxalt,\" a narrator says in the ad, as the phrases \"Big Oil\" and \"Adam Laxalt\" interlock on a crossword puzzle. \"He's been on their side for years.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Nevada's attorney general from 2015 to 2019, Laxalt opposed efforts by Democratic attorneys general to investigate whether oil companies misled the public about climate change. During his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2018, a super PAC largely funded by oil interests spent $2.5 million to support his run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a recording obtained by The Washington Post, Laxalt told a crowd of supporters that they need to push back on anyone highlighting his ties to Big Oil companies or claiming that those companies are responsible for high gasoline prices. (As of Friday, a gallon of gas cost an average of $4.89 in Nevada and $3.87 nationally, according to AAA.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You can't survive an economy where you go to $2 gas to $5.50, $6 gas,\" Laxalt said in the recording of the Southern Hills Republican Women luncheon in late July. \"And who is responsible for it? We all know it is not [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. And it is not greedy oil executives. And it is certainly not the private citizen.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokesman for Laxalt's campaign, Brian Freimuth, blamed high gas prices on Democrats. \"Biden Masto policies are the reason that energy prices have skyrocketed and Nevada voters are demanding change,\" Freimuth said in an email.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent weeks, Cortez Masto's campaign has also run two ads touting her efforts to include funding for wildfire management and prevention in last year's bipartisan infrastructure law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Catherine has been a vital partner to the fire service, and we know that we have her full support,\" Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran says in one of the ads, which shows firefighters battling a wall of orange flames during last year's destructive fire season.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laxalt has attributed recent blazes to poor forest management rather than global warming, though a growing body of research shows climate change has increased wildfires' frequency and intensity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Adam believes that proper forest management is essential to preventing the spread of dangerous wildfires and has emphasized his intention to fully support the brave officials working to protect Nevada lands,\" Freimuth said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Courting key constituencies</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democratic strategists remain optimistic that the drought money will help boost turnout for Cortez Masto \u2014 especially among the working-class and Latino voters who have formed the core of the Democratic machine built by the late Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think it will resonate with Nevadans who are sick of seeing inaction on things like climate change and drought,\" said Megan Jones, a Nevada operative working with the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto, the only Latina ever elected to the Senate, has sought to bolster her standing with Hispanic voters, a demographic that Biden won by 26 percentage points in the state in 2020. Her campaign started running Spanish-language ads in March and recently hosted a boisterous party at a community center with tables for Latin American countries and Mexican states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laxalt's campaign has unveiled its own strategy \u2014 dubbed \"Latinos for Laxalt\" \u2014 aimed at countering this approach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, Cortez Masto's climate pitch should resonate with Latinos, who are more vulnerable to climate impacts than many Americans. Nationwide, Latinos are 43 percent more likely than others to lose work hours and pay because of extreme heat, according to a report released last year by the Environmental Protection Agency. In Florida, Latino immigrants from Central and South America have collapsed from heatstroke while working at plant nurseries on especially hot days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Obed Castaneda, a part-time graphic designer and Uber driver, said he probably won't vote in the midterms because he doubts it would make a difference. He, too, had not heard of the $4 billion for drought mitigation in the climate bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Castaneda said many voters in Las Vegas are too busy working, whether at the bustling casinos on the Strip or other businesses around town, to pay attention to politics. He joked that the billboards on the Strip \u2014 whose neon letters advertise the newest concerts, comedy shows and gentleman's clubs \u2014 should instead spread awareness about the drought funding to residents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I want to see a freakin' billboard down the freakin' Strip,\" he said. \"You got that much money? Let's see it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young voters, who consistently rank climate change as a higher priority, account for 29.5 percent of registered Nevada voters and could play a key role in the race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Cortez Masto may not get much help from youth climate activists. The Las Vegas chapter of the Sunrise Movement, a key advocacy group, has declined to endorse her because she does not support the Green New Deal, the liberal proposal to eliminate the nation's fossil fuel use within a decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Dexter Lim, a 19-year-old co-founder of the chapter, said he prefers Cortez Masto to Laxalt, given her stronger support for renewable energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Of course we have to support her in this race because the alternative is much, much worse,\" Lim said.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

The Cairo-based artist has made the threat of a warming planet more visceral with an immersive installation \"Heaven and Hell in the Anthropocene,\" a reference to the current, human-centric geological age.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Installed in an area known as the Green Zone at COP27, the artwork features two unlabeled rooms \u2014 described as \"scenarios of eternity\" \u2014 that have different temperatures, sights, sounds and smells meant to represent two possible outcomes for humanity. Inspired by a 2011 study that suggests people who are in warm surroundings are more likely to say climate change is a problem, the piece, made in collaboration with the arts and social justice organization Fine Acts, underscores the physical and personal stakes of a global issue that, for many, can seem abstract and unmanageable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are trying to address climate anxiety by gamifying and simplifying scientific data, by making it relatable to everyday people and helping them feel like they have the power to make decisions,\" Shehab, 45, told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \"We just see floods and we see the news and we're scared. [The installation] is powerful because I can tell you something that's really complex in a very simple way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COP27 comes at the end of a year that has seen disastrous flooding in Pakistan, mudslides in South Africa, drought in China and heat waves in Europe and the United States. Through this sensory installation, Shehab hopes to give visitors a sense of agency and challenge those who say there is nothing we can do. She wants to make the threat feel immediate and tangible \u2014 but not insurmountable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's something instinctive. It doesn't have to do with our brains. It has to do with our biology,\" Shehab says of the psychology behind the artwork. The installation also taps into deeply ingrained spiritual beliefs, she said. \"The religious discourse that we've been fed for, like, millennia says, if you're bad, you'll burn in hell. Heat is bad.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before entering the installation viewers respond to a questionnaire: One question asks participants if they would agree to limit showering to four minutes, wash only with a bar of soap and reuse a day-old towel to conserve water and limit plastic usage. At the end, participants receive a score, which sends them to a room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some will find themselves in a light, domed interior set at a comfortable temperature in the low to mid-70s, surrounded by nature sounds and scents of \"freshness, orange blossoms,\" Shehab said. Others will find a dark, claustrophobic space set around 95 degrees and reeking of decomposing fruit and hospital rooms. So far, Shehab said she has sent 537 people to \"hell\" and 969 to \"heaven\" in what she calls a \"very interesting social experiment.\" Later, she encourages them to visit the other room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The piece is based on the concept of \"visceral fit\": the theory that \"people will judge states of the world associated with their current visceral experiences as more likely,\" according to researchers Jane Risen and Clayton Critcher. Thirst, for example, can increase expectations of drought and desertification. Warmth can increase concern about climate global warming. We think with our bodies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is in direct conflict with the way climate change has been historically discussed \u2014 with graphs and numbers and jargon. Shehab wants to counter that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I wanted a concept that everybody could understand,\" she said. \"I've had site workers and doctors and professors and climate activists and professionals and everybody walk through, and they all get it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While she recognizes that questions of personal responsibility \u2014 whether you recycle, for example \u2014 are only one small piece of the puzzle, she doesn't discount them. Her work is aimed at places where conversations about climate change are more limited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yes, we need to talk to the high polluters. We need to talk to those flying their private jets to COP,\" she said. \"But we also need to talk to developing nations with simpler discourses. And we really need education.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ever since she was a child, Shehab has admired climate activists, and in 2020 she got into the fray herself, building a pyramid of garbage in Cairo that stood nearly 20 feet high. It was meant to contrast the majestic pyramids of Giza with our current \"overproducing, over-consuming\" existence, she wrote in an artist's statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shehab, who is also a street artist and an art and design professor at the American University in Cairo, has long used art as a political and educational tool. During the Arab Spring, she created calligraphy-inspired graffiti with messages such as \"No to a new pharaoh\" and \"No to violence,\" written around Cairo. And while Britain was preparing to vote on Brexit, she wrote \"No to Borders\" and \"No to Brexit\" on walls in London.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In \"Heaven and Hell in the Anthropocene,\" which will be replicable, under an open license, after COP closes, Shehab wants people to say yes: Yes to wearing secondhand clothes; yes to conserving water; yes to anything they can do to curb climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both rooms of the installation, viewers will find mirrors \u2014 broken ones in hell and curved ones in heaven. The artist hopes they prompt reflection: \"For us to really face our future, we really need to look at ourselves.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Dino Grandoni, a national environment reporter for The Washington Post, wrote the top of today's newsletter. Below we have the latest on Hurricane Ian's devastating impact in Florida. But first:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As temperatures rise and habitats shrink, hundreds of thousands of plant and animal species around the world are at risk of vanishing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time, the United States is designating a special diplomat to advocate for global biodiversity amid what policymakers here and overseas increasingly recognize as an extinction crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monica Medina is taking on a new role as special envoy for biodiversity and water resources, the State Department announced Wednesday. She currently serves as the department's assistant secretary for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appointment underscores the Biden administration's desire to protect land and waters not just at home but to also conserve habitats abroad.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The loss of biodiversity isn't just a tragedy for wildlife. It's one of the biggest threats facing humanity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a major U.N. report in 2019, a million species face possible extinction, with dire implications for humans who depend on ecosystems for food, fresh water and other resources. Overfishing, pollution, pesticides, disease, urban sprawl and, of course, climate change contribute to declines in imperiled species' populations worldwide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's a direct connection between biodiversity loss and instability in a lot of parts of the world,\" Medina said in a recent phone interview. \"It's not just about nature for nature's sake. I think it is about people.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the Biden administration, Medina was an adjunct professor at Georgetown's Walsh School of Foreign Service and worked as general counsel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other government roles. She is the wife of White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her appointment comes weeks ahead of a major biodiversity conference in mid-December in Montreal. The meeting originally was scheduled to take place in the Chinese city of Kunming in 2020 but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The aim of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity \u2014 also known as COP-15 \u2014 is for nations to reverse the loss of species by adopting an international framework for conserving biodiversity. The effort is akin to the climate talks in 2015 that yielded the Paris agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the United States wants out of the conference: For nations to commit to conserving 30 percent of their land and water area. \"We are looking for ways to reach that goal, because that's what scientists tell us we need in order to have a healthy planet,\" Medina said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One big hurdle: Defining what, exactly, counts as land and water conserved? \"That is part of the discussion, is what counts,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the United States doing its part? President Biden set a goal of conserving nearly a third of the nation's land and waters by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has taken a few steps toward that target, restoring protections for two desert expanses in Utah and reinstating fishing restrictions in a marine monument off New England. Both moves reversed decisions made by President Donald Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Biden administration has yet to identify many other specific places for new protections. Medina noted that the Inflation Reduction Act passed this year set aside billions of dollars for conservation funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising seas flood forests and kill trees. Increasing temperatures allow for the greater spread of disease, such as an avian form of malaria that is wiping out birds in Hawaii. Warming waters leach out oxygen, suffocating marine life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But protecting ecosystems such as forests and peatlands, Medina noted, will help keep climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere in the first place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a crisis that we face that's interwoven with the climate crisis, but also independent and important on its own,\" she said. \"If we can solve the biodiversity crisis, we're a long way along the way to solving the climate crisis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Update: This story has been updated to include that Medina is married to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Ian gradually weakened into a tropical storm early Thursday, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. Although storm surge is thought to have already peaked, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned late Wednesday that decimation is likely to continue throughout the state, Jason Samenow, Kelly Kasulis Cho and Annabelle Timsit report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center said Ian, which is tearing toward Florida's Atlantic coast, is expected to further weaken Friday night and into Saturday, but \"could be near hurricane strength\" on Friday when it approaches South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 2.5 million customers are without power, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages across the country. Conditions are expected to deteriorate as Ian moves inland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ian jumped from a Category 3 storm Tuesday night to just shy of a Category 5 on Wednesday morning, a distinct marker of climate change. The rapid intensification of storms, which has occurred more frequently in recent decades, is tied to rising ocean temperatures. The warmer water helps fuel hurricanes, allowing them to grow, strengthen and release more rain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other updates include:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The monster storm will drop 12 to 20 inches of rain over central and northeast Florida, with localized amounts up to 30 inches, according to the National Hurricane Center. Flash flooding is one of the most serious threats from tropical storms because it happens quickly and occurs far from shore. The slow-moving nature of Ian means that torrents of rain will fall across the state for a longer period of time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a news briefing Wednesday night, DeSantis said there would be an influx of personnel and supplies available to those in need, and that first responders would probably be able to reach residents in high-risk areas when conditions are safer at first light Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>DeSantis also sent an official letter to President Biden on Wednesday requesting a major disaster declaration for the entire state, asking for full federal reimbursement of response and recovery costs for the first 60 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The swath of coastline that is facing the most disastrous effects from Hurricane Ian has been undergoing rapid development in recent decades, putting exponentially more assets and people in harm's way, The Washington Post's Simon Ducroquet, Brady Dennis and John Muyskens report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From 1970 to 2020, census records show that the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area expanded by 623 percent to more than 760,000 people. At the same time, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area saw growth of more than 187 percent and is now home to more than 3.1 million people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stephen Strader, a hazards geographer and professor at Villanova University, said as more people and businesses move to the beach, it creates an overwhelming opportunity for weather-related disasters to wreak havoc.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Then throw on sea level rise and climate change on top of that, and you are looking at a multi-headed monster,\" Strader said. \"We really haven't done much to check this growth. \u2026 What we are finding out is that is not sustainable.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) on Tuesday said that he was pulling his energy permitting plan from a stopgap government funding bill, many environmental groups rejoiced. But the bill also included a provision to rapidly expand transmission lines, which are crucial for helping the United States meet its bold climate goals, Shannon Osaka reports for The Post.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Manchin's bill, dubbed the Energy Independence and Security Act, was intended to help speed the approval process for new clean and fossil-fuel energy projects by setting up a two-year target for environmental reviews and granting the federal government the authority to build transmission lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, many climate activists argued that although the bill would accelerate the nation's transition to clean energy, its potential benefits do not outweigh the harms of locking in additional greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, those power lines are necessary for carrying renewable electricity from sunny and windy areas of the country to urban centers. According to an analysis from Princeton University, the newly passed Inflation Reduction Act could cut U.S. emissions 40 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. But that calculation hinges on whether the nation manages to increase transmission by 2.3 percent per year. If transmission grows only 1 percent per year, the modelers predict that 80 percent of the new climate law's benefits could be lost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>European Union leaders on Wednesday launched investigations into random, simultaneous breaches of three major underwater natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea, pointing to Russian sabotage, Meg Kelly and Michael Birnbaum report for The Post.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts said the blasts potentially mark the largest-ever single release of methane into the atmosphere from the energy sector. The gas is more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere. Thomas Lauvaux, a researcher with the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France, said that in a worst-case scenario the leak could cause the same amount of planet-warming pollution that 1 million cars do in a year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell vowed a \"robust and united response\" to any attacks on the 27-nation bloc's energy infrastructure. Though the probes have only just begun, many politicians blamed Russia, saying that the explosions are the next step in the Kremlin's strategy as it continues to wage a war in Ukraine and use energy supplies as leverage over Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called accusations that Russia was responsible for the explosions \"predictably stupid\" and \"absurd.\" He told reporters on a call that Moscow has no interest in damaging the pipelines \u2014 which are majority-owned Russian entities \u2014 because of the high value of the gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Photos: Hurricane Ian makes landfall in Florida as Category 4 \u2014 The Post</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Ian is pulling water away from ocean shores.

Really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom took the stage to cheers in the hot afternoon sun in Orange County the other day. For 20 minutes, he talked about the Democratic candidates for Congress and the California Legislature. He talked about President Trump. He talked about poverty, homelessness, immigration and global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there was one topic that Mr. Newsom, the lieutenant governor, barely mentioned: the fact that he is the Democratic candidate for governor of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom\u2019s decision to glide over that point is testimony to his dominant position in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. As a Democrat in a lopsidedly blue state, Mr. Newsom is far ahead of his Republican opponent, the business executive John Cox, in polls. And a key purpose of his campaign swing, he said, is to promote Democratic candidates for Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with the threat of an economic downturn, escalating hostility with the Trump White House, and looming decisions about how to respond to entrenched poverty, climate change and a dysfunctional state tax system, California may be entering turbulent waters. And Mr. Newsom\u2019s low-risk campaign, along with a widespread sense that the outcome of the contest is almost a foregone conclusion, suggests voters may learn little between now and Election Day about Mr. Newsom\u2019s qualifications and what he intends to do should he take over as the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox have not agreed to any televised debates. Mr. Cox, trailing in fund-raising , has struggled to draw attention to his attacks on Mr. Newsom. \u201cPoliticians like Gavin Newsom talk about change, but they\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Mr. Cox said in a radio advertisement airing across the state. Only the occasional television crew and handful of reporters have turned up for Mr. Newsom\u2019s stops.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t think this campaign will test him,\u201d said Jim Newton, a lecturer on public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cAnd that\u2019s too bad. He\u2019s a quality candidate. It\u2019s too bad we are not given a chance to see more of him and learn what he would do. I think he plays defense through Election Day.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom asserted that California voters had plenty of opportunities to learn about him during a career in public service that included a turn as mayor of San Francisco and as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the trail for three years,\u201d he said, as his four young children scampered up and down his campaign bus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe question of being challenged, of what kind of governor are you going to be: We\u2019ve had that vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been as scrutinized as much as any candidate for political office in some time, in terms of my tenure as mayor, my tenure as county supervisor.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom said that voters were most interested in talking about the president. \u201cMy town halls, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care, Trump. Environment, Trump. Jobs, economy, Trump. Anxiety, fear, Trump.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, Mr. Newsom has spent more than seven years as Mr. Brown\u2019s lieutenant governor, a low-profile position that has little authority or assigned duties. It has proved to be a particularly obscure role under the shadow of a governor like Mr. Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom won widespread attention as mayor of San Francisco \u2014 where, among other things, he championed same-sex marriage at a time when it was a contentious issue even in his own party. Still, being mayor of a city of 871,000 people does not present the same challenges that come with being the leader of a state like California, with a population of 39.4 million people, an increasingly assertive State Legislature and an ever-expanding catalog of problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Newsom so far has offered often vague responses on some of the biggest issues he would face: global warming, the over-budget high-speed rail train between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the state\u2019s volatile tax code, which Mr. Newsom has said needs an overhaul, while saying it was too early to say how.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom signaled during the primary that he would support a California-financed single-payer health care program, over the objections of opponents who said it was unaffordable. Since his primary victory, Mr. Newsom has said it was unlikely to be accomplished during his first term as governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cSomeone said, \u2018you are backtracking on single-payer,\u2019\u201d he said, when pressed on the question. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually expressing an outline. I\u2019m architecting the conversation over the next few years. It\u2019s not an act that is going to occur by a signature of a governor.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Newsom, an opponent of the death penalty, said he had not decided what to do if he is forced to preside over the first execution in more than a decade in a state that has more inmates on death row \u2014 over 700 \u2014 than any other. In 2016, California passed a proposition forcing the state to resume executions, although there are legal challenges outstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would Mr. Newsom sign a death warrant? \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to answer the question,\u201d he said, clearly struggling with the issue. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not prepared to answer the question. But I am preparing myself to answer the question. And in that preparation comes a lot of soul searching.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, said a central question is how Mr. Newsom might reconcile his liberal appeal from the primary with running a state. \u201cSince he positioned himself in the primary in the progressive wing of the party, what will he do when presented with legislation that, while popular in the party, will be difficult to implement in government?\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Brown from his first days as lieutenant governor. Mr. Newsom recounted how shortly after he took office, he put out his own economic plan for California \u2014 and was quickly reminded who was in charge by Mr. Brown\u2019s office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, he faces the challenge of trying to at once align himself with the popular Mr. Brown while acknowledging criticisms that Mr. Cox and others have offered on the governor and what has taken place under his watch in California, from housing costs to homelessness to growing poverty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat happened to our state?\u201d he said in Seal Beach. In Torrance, he called homelessness \u201cthe ultimate manifestation of our failure. It happened on our watch. We own that.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cUnless we deal with the affordability crisis, the California Dream will no longer exist,\u201d he said after he got back on his bus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom said he would expect pressure from lawmakers to restore spending that Mr. Brown had cut. He said he would mostly continue Mr. Brown\u2019s frugal ways, but signaled he was ready to spend money in areas where Mr. Brown had not \u2014 in particular, early childhood education and higher education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI get why people worry about it, because if immediately you connote me with San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi, everything \u2014 I get where that anxiety comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will soon learn that I am going to be very stubborn as it relates to the budget and fiscal discipline. At the same time less stubborn on some investments that Jerry has understandably danced around.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom said the outgoing governor had left the state \u201cin better shape than probably any governor in modern times.\u201d But he said that Mr. Brown had given him a somewhat mordant warning as they discussed what was around the corner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201c\u2018Good luck,\u2019\u201d he quoted Mr. Brown as saying. \u201c\u2019Cause he sees the headwinds, he sees the fixed costs, he sees the hockey stick of health care and pensions. He sees all this building pressure, he knows what the Legislature is revving up to do and all these interest groups that are a deeper part of that appetite than the Legislature. They are all expecting the next governor to solve their problems.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At 50, Mr. Newsom retains the aura of glamour from his days as a young mayor, with a full head of slicked-back hair. When he showed up to speak for an assembly candidate running in the South Bay of Los Angeles, Democrats clamored outside his bus, waiting to catch a view or a photograph. He emerged carrying boxes of pizza.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHe\u2019s so photogenic,\u201d said Carol Pike-Bauer, 92, a retired chemical engineer. She said she had been following his career since he was San Francisco mayor and admired his willingness to go against the federal government on gay marriage. \u201cHe did what he thought was right and fair,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As mayor, Mr. Newsom\u2019s personal life was also terrain for the gossip columns. He was a fixture on the city\u2019s party circuit, and later admitted to an affair with the wife of his campaign manager. He got a divorce and underwent treatment for alcohol abuse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, Mr. Newsom travels the state with his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker, and their children. His son Hunter, 7, kept tugging at the back of his pants, clamoring for attention as Mr. Newsom tried to speak at the rally here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Californians who turned up for his events said they were pleased to hear him talk about issues like global warming and immigration, even in Republican parts of the state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe do have a strong Republican base here \u2014 some issues he\u2019s talking about people will disapprove of,\u201d said John Henry Lopez, 47, a plumber who came to hear him speak in Fresno. \u201cBut he will be helped by the cost of health care. That\u2019s a strong message that can get people to vote.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brock Neeley, 53, who drove from Tulare to see Mr. Newsom in Fresno, said the area is \u201cturning blue, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cPeople are finally getting fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cFarmers who voted for Trump are seeing their crops in the field. Global warming affects us big time.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his speeches, delivered without notes and in shirt sleeves, Mr. Newsom plucked quotes from Aristotle, Plutarch, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Oliver Wendell Holmes as he presented himself as the next face of the Democratic opposition in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While his first advertisement was upbeat, focusing on prenatal care and job training, he made clear that future advertisements are likely to focus on Mr. Cox\u2019s connections to the president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cMy opponent has doubled down on all things Trump,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, in one of the few times he mentioned his opponent by name. \u201cThat\u2019s a very challenging place for Cox to be.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Adam Nagourney and Tim Arango\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

As she crossed the wide marsh in the dark, the water rose quickly. It became too deep -- ahead and behind. She had to stop and wait.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To her, no longer were climate change predictions an abstract idea. Sea level has been rising, taking her waterfront with it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This isn't something that's coming,\" she later told a group of bay shore residents and officials. \"It's here. We just happen to live in a place that will affect us sooner.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wren lives on tiny Money Island -- more a peninsula of bayfront land -- with about 40 small homes and trailers in Cumberland County.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just visible across the grassy marsh is Gandys Beach with 80 homes. Farther south, Fortescue with 250 homes. All three are steadily disappearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Atlantic coast, beach replenishment masks the effects of sea level rise. But along the low-lying bay shore, veined with creeks, the problems are striking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With each nor'easter, more of the beachfronts erode. More of the streets and driveways flood. Septic systems, inundated with saltwater, are failing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're seeing beyond the normal damage,\" said Steve Eisenhauer, a regional director with the Natural Lands Trust, which has a 7,000-acre preserve in the area. \"We see the problems getting worse.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the last century, sea level in the bay has risen a foot, gauges show, partly because the warming ocean is expanding and polar ice is melting. Also, New Jersey is sinking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the while, humans have been pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The planet's average temperature has increased.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"All those links are very strong,\" said Pennsylvania State University's Raymond Najjar Jr., an expert on climate change in Mid-Atlantic estuaries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The reason the sea is rising as fast as it is in the Delaware Bay is human-induced climate change,\" he said, echoing many experts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sea level is rising faster now than in the early 20th century, and scientists expect it to rise even faster in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three towns' beachfronts and marshes have always been nibbled away by ship wakes, storms and more typical erosion -- but a rising sea level, combined with more frequent and intense storms, makes them all worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Can these three communities, all within Downe Township, adapt to climate change?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or is there a point beyond which no amount of money can stop the sea? Should everyone relocate?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's been done. After a $1.8-million seawall in nearby Sea Breeze failed a year after being built, the state bought out the 23 remaining households three years ago for $3.3 million. Tiny Thompson's Beach and Moore's Beach are gone too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are special places, where people look out their windows and see eagles soaring. The bay turns red at sunset. Salt marshes thick with aquatic life stretch for miles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With marinas in Fortescue and Money Island, they are among the last places in South Jersey where people can access Delaware Bay -- vital for generating support to preserve the rich habitat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, like Wren, residents sometimes see whitecaps in their driveways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Downe officials have come up with a $50-million plan to not only shore up the shore, but also add amenities across the township to draw tourists who could revive the economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plan, which would cost the equivalent of $31,500 per resident, calls for bulkheads and truckloads of sand, restrooms, picnic benches, nature-viewing areas and a township visitor center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Officials identified nearly 30 \"potential\" funders -- including agencies and nonprofit groups. But many feel the project is a long shot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, bumper stickers are plastered on homes: \"No retreat. Save the Bayshore communities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I refuse to give up one house, one lot, one piece of land,\" said Robert Campbell, Downe's mayor. \"These towns are 200 years old. It's a special place. We've got to preserve it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their survival is also fiscally crucial; they represent half of Downe's tax base.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He and others blame flooding not on a rising sea level but on the decline of dikes once used for salt hay farming. Scientists say the dikes blocked the tides from naturally bolstering mashes with sediment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Campbell also accuses the state of being too tough in issuing permits for bulkheads and jetties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Hurricane Irene struck in 2011, the town put up temporary bulkheads. The state issued violation notices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, those structures need restoration too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>::</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before modern travel made all the Atlantic beaches easily accessible, Delaware Bay was the shore that many Philadelphians went to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the late 1800s, Fortescue was the Cape May of the bay shore, with hotels and a boardwalk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are so rich in our history,\" said Dennis Cook of Money Island, who specified in his will that his ashes be thrown off his pier. \"We can survive.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or at least they feel compelled to try. Many residents are retirees who have sunk their savings into their homes. Now that prices have fallen, they can't get out unless the state buys them out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nine Money Island property owners have already requested that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is Tony Novak, owner of the local marina. He wants to stay, and thinks he can for the near future, but \"there is no doubt that the only reasonable, logical, long-term approach is strategic retreat.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have neighbors,\" he said, \"and all they have left in the world is being washed away.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In October, Wren held a forum named for what many consider the hot issue for the bay shore: \"Rising Tides.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 100 people went to the nearby hamlet of Bivalve on the Maurice River and filled a chilly room in a historic shipyard shed owned by the nonprofit Bayshore Discovery Project, which Wren founded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It owns New Jersey's tall ship, a historic oyster schooner called the A.J. Meerwald, and the walls of the room were lined with vintage oyster cans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Outside, docks built in the early 1900s still exist, and old-timers notice that the tide comes up higher than it used to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the serpentine Maurice River, erosion -- a natural process worsened by sea level rise -- has almost cut through the bend at Bivalve. If it occurs, the docks might end up high and dry, and land to the east will flood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward the bay are \"ghost forests\" -- skeletons of trees killed by saltwater intrusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Upstream, a quarter-century of bird counts shows that black vultures, a Southern species, are becoming more numerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In decline are American black ducks, which depend on a freshwater wild rice that is being depleted as saltier water moves up the Maurice River.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The coast is changing,\" Jennifer Adkins told the group in Bivalve that night.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The executive director of the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, she cited research showing the dramatic loss of the bay's wetlands. Nearly 5,000 football fields' worth vanished from 1996 to 2006 alone, mostly from sea level rise and erosion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wetlands protect coastal areas by absorbing water from storm surges, so losing these natural buffers makes the bay shore communities more vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matt Blake, then with the American Littoral Society, raised the topic few wanted to hear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Strategic retreat,\" he said. \"The questions of whether to pull back or reinforce are going to come up again and again.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't claim to have an answer. But he said solutions should be based on research, not emotion. \"We'll never have enough resources to defend every community. Before we start spending on new roads and bridges and pipes, we have to run a cost-benefit analysis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Campbell wouldn't hear of it. \"There seems to be a double standard between the Atlantic coast communities and the Delaware Bay,\" the mayor said when he got to the lectern. A murmur of assent rose from the audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't hear anybody talking about retreat in Atlantic City,\" he said. Or \"moving the casinos back to Absecon.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he handed out a summary of township problems: collapsed pavement, eroded road shoulders, failing seawalls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Downe Township is just one hurricane away from becoming a bayfront statistic\" like the three other abandoned towns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eleven days later, Superstorm Sandy hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bayfront houses were undermined, the sand washing out from under them. Front steps hung in the air. Decks and front rooms were gone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Campbell said damage along the bay front totaled $20 million; about 30 homes were destroyed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Sandy focused everybody's attention,\" Wren said. \"You can't just quietly ignore [the rising ocean] anymore.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Bauers writes for the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: MAYOR BOB CAMPBELL of Downe Township stands by storm-damaged homes in Fortescue. \"I refuse to give up one house, one lot, one piece of land,\" he said.; PHOTOGRAPHER:Charles Fox Philadelphia Inquirer; PHOTO: HOMES ALONG DELAWARE BAY, including in Fortescue, N.J., have been damaged or destroyed by erosion and storms.

What if we grew new forests on vacant city lots, old industrial buildings \u2014 even golf courses?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time, scientists have sought to quantify this thought experiment. How many trees could be planted on every available parcel of land on Earth, where they could go, and what impact could that have on our survival?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They concluded that the planet could support nearly 2.5 billion additional acres of forest without shrinking our cities and farms, and that those additional trees, when they mature, could store a whole lot of the extra carbon \u2014 200 gigatons of carbon, to be precise \u2014 generated by industrial activity over the last 150 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parts of the study \u2014 led by researchers at ETH Zurich, a university that specializes in science, technology and engineering \u2014 were immediately criticized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The critics did not dispute that 200 gigatons of carbon could be absorbed by trees if you planted them on every space of land available. They disputed the implications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study\u2019s authors asserted that, under their model, forest restoration could absorb two-thirds of historic emissions. Zeke Hausfather, an analyst for the climate science website Carbon Brief, said the true figure would be closer to one-third. That\u2019s because part of the emissions absorbed by the additional trees would have been absorbed by the soil or the seas anyway.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say that reforestation is not an important mitigation strategy, just to caution that like every other climate solution, it\u2019s part of a larger portfolio of strategies rather than a silver bullet,\u201d Mr. Hausfather said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, an Australia-based scientific group that produces global carbon budgets, said that reforestation \u201cwon\u2019t fix the climate problem, albeit it should be part of the solution.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senior author of the study, Thomas Crowther, a professor of environmental systems science at ETH Zurich, acknowledged that mass reforestation would not be a quick fix for climate change but said it would result in an \u201cunexpectedly huge carbon drawdown solution\u201d in the long term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe new information simply allows us to re-prioritize investment into the restoration of forests and the conservation of existing forests as this has more potential for carbon capture than we could have anticipated,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the start of the industrial age, the average global temperature has risen by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, because of accelerating greenhouse gas emissions. Temperatures are on track to rise even more in the coming years, raising the prospects of debilitating heat waves, wildfires and rising seas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason forests are important is that they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and incorporate it into their roots and branches. That absorbed carbon becomes part of the soil when trees die and decompose. Depending on factors like temperature and soil management, it can remain there for millenniums.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some cases \u2014 like when there is a forest fire, or when a drought or pest infestation destroys a large number of trees \u2014 a forest can release more carbon than it absorbs. But one study, led by University of Arizona researchers, found that even mass die-offs of trees release less carbon than expected into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest United Nations-backed climate science panel has estimated that it would take 2.5 billion acres of new forest cover to stave off the most devastating impacts of climate change. The study led by ETH Zurich tried to quantify where on Earth new trees could be grown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The researchers used Google Earth to generate maps of what they call Earth\u2019s tree-carrying capacity, taking into account the effects of rising temperatures in the near-term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A handful of countries could make a very big difference. The researchers found that Russia could restore 373 million acres, or 151 million hectares, of forest. That was followed by the United States, with 255 million acres and Canada with 193 million acres. Other large countries like Australia, Brazil and China also have large areas suitable for forest restoration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

How dare you!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear.  How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you're doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency.  But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that.  Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil.  And that I refuse to believe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1. 5 degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty percent may be acceptable to you.  But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice.  They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us \u2014 we who have to live with the consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1. 5 degrees global temperature rise \u2014 the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] \u2014 the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on Jan.  1, 2018.  Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just \"business as usual\" and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than eight and a half years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You are failing us.

The report spurred the White House to make plans for an internal working group to counter the scientific consensus that climate change represents a major threat to the United States and the globe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For a president who has yet to receive an extensive scientific briefing on climate change, the topic amounts to a political litmus test ahead of the 2020 elections. Rather than accept the conclusions espoused by elites and loathed by many of his voters, Trump has opted to question the premise that global warming represents a major problem or, at times, if it even exists at all. And now through its new working group, his National Security Council is working to muster ammunition for his arguments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meade Krosby, a senior scientist at the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group, said the initiative showed a disconnect with reality. The world has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial levels, and a recent U.N. scientific report concluded the world will have to cut its carbon output 45\u00a0percent by 2030 to avert some of the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The idea that what we really need is to revisit the basic science of climate change when we are already feeling its impacts is absurd,\" she said. \"There is no meaningful scientific disagreement on the facts.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Steven Milloy, a climate change skeptic who served on Trump's transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency and questioned humans' contribution to climate change, said Trump is simply keeping his promise to millions of voters who backed him in 2016 after he campaigned on the energy policies he is now pursuing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't have a problem with people having different points of view. It's the president that gets elected,\" said Milloy, who previously ran a group that received funding from the oil industry. \"In the end, it's the president agenda, and he gets to decide.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House's push against climate science has exposed a modest rift within the Republican Party, as some are edging toward a more centrist position. And it has provided a potential political opportunity for Democrats, who have been grappling with their own intraparty fight over how ambitious to be when it comes to cutting carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced this week that all 47 senators in the Democratic caucus had signed on to a resolution saying that climate change is real, caused by humans and that Congress needs to take immediate action on it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Tuesday, former Ohio governor John Kasich (R), who ran against Trump in 2016, said recent federal reports have settled the debate over climate science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The government is giving us reports saying this is [a] problem,\" Kasich said at a University of British Columbia lecture. \"And the Defense Department and America's preparing for climate change, global warming and the implications of it all. So there are very little questions anymore.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump sees the climate debate as a war of political messaging, according to several current and former administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. Convinced that the scientific literature on climate change is funded and directed by liberals, he has said on repeated occasions that he expects the climate to change back to colder average temperatures. It amounts to an endorsement of the \"global cooling\" forecast some researchers made in the 1970s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Trump and his aides discussed whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement two years ago, he emphasized the impact low-carbon policies could have on average Americans. Under the accord, the United States pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions between 26 and 28\u00a0percent by 2025.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Trump occasionally asks aides for their opinions on climate change, he has been unwavering in his denial that human activity bears the brunt of the blame.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"When you talk to him about it, he's openly skeptical,\" George David Banks, who served as special assistant to the president for international energy and environment during the start of Trump's term, said in an interview. \"The reason he's skeptical is he sees it as being detrimental to U.S. manufacturing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Deputies who have sought to make the case for climate action to Trump have not fared well. During a meeting just weeks before the president announced the United States would exit the Paris agreement, then-National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn noted that several major chief executives had just published a joint letter urging him to stay within the deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Gary, my voters don't live on Park Avenue,\" Trump responded, according to one participant who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. \"They don't care about the same things you care about.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris deal in 2017, climate change has rarely come up as a priority inside the White House, according to current and former officials. \"He knows his voters see it as bunk,\" a White House official said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's views have been largely consistent for the better part of a decade, as he has railed against renewable energy and claimed that environmentalism puts U.S. industry at a disadvantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's rejection of climate science stretches back to at least 2010. Shortly after signing a letter calling for U.S. action to combat climate change, Trump changed course and began calling the whole concept \"a con,\" voicing many of the same arguments he uses today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a February 2010 interview on Fox News, Trump noted the \"freezing\" temperatures at the time, and claimed that the United States was \"scrubbing\" its coal while China, Japan and India pursued dirtier energy, putting American companies \"at a competitive disadvantage.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's probably getting a little bit warmer,\" Trump said. \"And then, in a number of years or decades, it will get a little bit cooler.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2012, he tweeted that \"the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.\" And in the years leading up to his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump continued to opine about global warming, seizing on cold snaps to argue that the science showing rising temperatures and sea levels amounted to a \"hoax.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-science views espoused by Trump allow him to cast aside inconvenient facts and shape an argument that aligns with his political goals and his other long-held views, said Tim O'Brien, author of \"TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's performance art,\" he said. \"I don't think he authentically believes climate change was authored in Beijing. He just knows that it dovetails neatly with his anti-China, anti-free-trade, anti-climate-change mantra. And he can put that to political use.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has already begun targeting his potential 2020 opponents over their environmental positions. The president also touted January's frigid temperatures in much of the United States but ignored his government's announcement two weeks later that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures,\" Trump tweeted after the Democratic senator from Minnesota made her presidential announcement in a snowstorm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some federal officials in top scientific posts offer a more nuanced view on climate change, but they choose their words carefully.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Certainly, the climate is changing; it has been changing. It's a combination of natural variability and human influence,\" Kelvin Droegemeier, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in an interview last week. \"Over the past 70 years or so, human influence has played a significant role.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2013, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report saying global warming is \"unequivocal\" and that it is \"extremely likely\" that humans are the \"dominant\" cause of climate change over the past century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump own military leaders and intelligence heads have said in public reports that climate change poses a national security threat to the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as president, Trump's views on environmental science have drifted further from the mainstream even as he has had access to the world's greatest scientists and data.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a November interview with The Washington Post, Trump claimed that dirty air from Asia \"blows over\" toward the United States. He also rejected calls for climate action by claiming that U.S. air and water is already \"record clean.\" He has claimed that California's record wildfires in 2018 were caused because of the state's improper \"raking\" of its forests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are convinced that Trump's position on climate change could prove a liability for congressional Republicans, most of whom have raised questions about climate science and worked to reverse Obama-era regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions. Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would force a vote on House Democrats' Green New Deal, a sweeping measure that would spend trillions to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NSC is pressing ahead with its plan to convene federal researchers to decide how the White House might reassess the government's climate findings, and it has asked agencies to find outside experts who endorse the idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kasich, who called on lawmakers Tuesday to impose either a tax on carbon or a nationwide cap on emissions, said that eventually voters would pressure his party to act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Do you know why politicians will finally get off the dime?\" Kasich said. \"Because they'll have no choice.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>juliet.eilperin@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>juliet.eilperin@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>toluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>toluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Josh Dawsey and Tony Romm contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 10}

She had been in Santa Barbara for a workshop and couldn\u2019t take the train home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe track was gone,\u201d she recalled this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So she hitched a ride with a colleague. She remembers seeing the ocean on one side of her and fire on the other as they drove. \u201cIt was like heaven and hell.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That year, fires tore through the San Diego region, leaving 16 people dead and 2,400 homes destroyed. One of the blazes, the Cedar fire, was at the time the largest in California history, burning more than 273,000 acres.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, that record has been demolished as climate change has lengthened fire seasons and caused the blazes themselves to burn hotter and faster. Last year, five of the six largest fires in the state\u2019s known history together chewed through nearly 2.5 million acres. The Cedar fire is now the state\u2019s eighth-largest blaze, and the only one in the top 10 to have taken place before 2010.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, as Altintas told me, technology has also advanced in the years since 2003. That, she said, can help both prevent out-of-control wildfires and minimize the destruction they cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt gives us hope,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Altintas is the founder and director of the university\u2019s WIFIRE Lab, where she and her team have worked over the past eight years to use data to help fire managers and scientists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And in the last decade or so, the quantity of data has increased. A lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where once there were basic weather cameras used by surfers, there are now vast systems taking in almost real-time satellite views, sensing wind patterns, tracking utility service and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All that information, coupled with troves of data about past blazes, can be used with artificial intelligence to quickly predict how fires will burn once they have ignited, and to help plan measures, like prescribed burns, aimed at preventing bigger, more dangerous fires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s been an information revolution,\u201d Altintas said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She demonstrated the lab\u2019s fire map, which she said was used to help fight every major fire in the state. The interface was intuitive, like a more colorful Google map.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Altintas clicked on filters that showed ongoing fires in detail \u2014 where they were actively burning and where they had already been \u2014 along with the areas that had been burned by fires in the past. She said she could pull up camera views from weather stations or see how a given fire might have burned if conditions had been different, and how close it would have come to where people live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, she said, helps fire officials decide where to send resources to battle a fast-moving blaze and which areas to evacuate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A product known as BurnPro 3D showed, as the name suggests, three-dimensional images of vegetation down to a one-meter resolution. That can help fire managers prioritize where they should intentionally light fires when it\u2019s safe to do so, because they can see where fuels have built up to dangerous levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In coming years, Altintas said, she hopes the fire map and BurnPro 3D will help significantly streamline the permitting process for prescribed burns and will be able to help predict where there is a risk for landslides or flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThose are all very relatable things that can happen at any time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we want to pull together the data and modeling community to model those as fast as we can.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, she emphasized that one of the lab\u2019s most important functions is making data \u2014 and tools for analyzing it \u2014 accessible to a wide range of collaborators across the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That, Altintas said, is the only way that scientists and officials can even attempt to keep up with rapidly changing environmental challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe main thing here is we can\u2019t just react,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more people to say, \u2018We can do something about it.\u2019\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow all of The Times\u2019s heat wave and wildfire coverage here.California spent more than $1 billion on emergency wildfire suppression last year, The San Francisco Chronicle reports.Read about how that\u2019s a fraction of the total cost of wildfires, including damages and health consequences.The Los Angeles Times reports that fires have burned more than 140,000 acres so far this year in California, with the biggest blazes burning faster and hotter than some firefighters have seen this early in the year.Explore WIFIRE Lab\u2019s Firemap, developed with the Orange County Fire Authority, CalOES, the Los Angeles Fire Department and more.And learn more about WIFIRE Commons, developed with federal agencies, the Los Alamos National Lab and dozens of other partners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow all of The Times\u2019s heat wave and wildfire coverage here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California spent more than $1 billion on emergency wildfire suppression last year, The San Francisco Chronicle reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read about how that\u2019s a fraction of the total cost of wildfires, including damages and health consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Los Angeles Times reports that fires have burned more than 140,000 acres so far this year in California, with the biggest blazes burning faster and hotter than some firefighters have seen this early in the year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Explore WIFIRE Lab\u2019s Firemap, developed with the Orange County Fire Authority, CalOES, the Los Angeles Fire Department and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And learn more about WIFIRE Commons, developed with federal agencies, the Los Alamos National Lab and dozens of other partners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here\u2019s what else to know today</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The close ties between coroners and law enforcement have fueled an unusual and unregulated industry: for-profit forensic examinations, The New York Times Magazine reports.NBC Los Angeles discussed the homelessness crisis with former Gov.

It estimated the damage to shareholders to be between $476 million and $1.6 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Exxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate-change regulation,\" the complaint says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \nEnergy Stocks Fall Faster Than Oil Prices\n(Oct. 16)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon has denied wrongdoing and said a reasonable investor wouldn't expect to know such internal details. The company has also accused the attorneys general involved, all Democrats, of being motivated by politics in bringing the case, which the office has denied.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil industry has said that it is difficult to estimate the future costs of climate-change regulation, which is uncertain politically and varies across national boundaries, as investors have demanded more information.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trial is being watched closely, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at financial-services firm Edward Jones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A verdict in the attorney general's favor could damage Exxon's reputation and bolster federal lawsuits filed by shareholders in Texas and New Jersey that make similar allegations, which Exxon has also denied. It could also spur future investigations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It could open up a big can of worms,\" Ms. Rowland said. \"Other companies could be looked at and questioned about what assumptions they have made.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A win for Exxon could insulate the company from similar suits and would represent another blow for climate-change lawsuits. Federal judges have \ntossed other climate-change cases\n, including when New York, San Francisco and other cities \nsued oil companies in the past several years\nto recoup costs incurred from the effects of rising global temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tuesday's proceedings mark only the second trial of a case where climate change is a central issue in U.S. history, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. In the first, he said, a federal judge in 2007 upheld a Vermont regulation on emissions standards that had been challenged by auto makers and dealers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New York attorney general's office \nsued Exxon last October\n, saying its climate-change disclosure methods were \"sanctioned at the highest levels of the company.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prosecutors said Mr. Tillerson was aware of misrepresentations to investors. They said the then-chief executive used a different email address, with the alias Wayne Tracker, for internal correspondence about these matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokeswoman for Mr. Tillerson referred a request for comment to Exxon. An Exxon spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a deposition, Mr. Tillerson said he used the Wayne Tracker address because of the heavy volume of email going to the account that used his real name. He also referred to differing calculations as an \"academic debate.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Central to the trial is the calculation of proxy costs, or formulas the company used to calculate the risk of future regulation. Such disclosures were important to investors because they spoke to the company's financial health, the attorney general's office said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The differences were sometimes stark. In oil-sands projects in Alberta, Canada, Exxon understated the costs of future government regulation by $25 billion, the office said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon has said regulation in Alberta \"has been and remains in flux, with rival political factions enacting and repealing climate regulations regularly.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon says reasonable investors understood it weighed climate risks while not disclosing proprietary details. It had different ways of calculating regulation risks and applied them in appropriate contexts, its lawyers wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case is divisive partly because it relies on the Martin Act, a broad New York state law that has been employed to pursue Wall Street fraud.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is an abuse of the Martin Act,\" said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, which fights what it views as excessive litigation. \"By all indications, this is a lawsuit to carry out a political agenda.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernie Nash, co-head of the state attorneys general practice at firm Cozen O'Connor P.C., said the case was an atypical use of the Martin Act. In the past, the courts have allowed for broad uses of the Martin Act, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Philosophically, no statute is limitless and you don't know when you've exceeded it until the court says so,\" Mr. Nash said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Corinne Ramey at \nCorinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Corinne Ramey\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

These officials have been purposefully trying to head off the addition of any mandates on manufacturers, refiners, cement-makers and other heavy industries. Others deny that is a preordained goal of the rulemaking, while acknowledging it may still be a likely outcome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of the policy change acknowledge that their effort could be undone if President Trump doesn't win re-election in November. The initiative could also face challenges in court, or from Congress .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since 2007, the EPA has been operating under a Supreme Court ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The EPA produced a subsequent decision in 2009, \"the endangerment finding,\" that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These precedents have been an obstacle to Mr. Trump's push for deregulation. His appointees at the EPA have sought ways to blunt the power of those precedents and block the spread of similar restrictions to other industries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's quite clear they're not good-faith stewards of environmental law,\" said Lauren Pagel, policy director at the advocacy organization Earthworks, which monitors methane leaks at oil and gas operations in states like Texas and New Mexico. \"If they're going to go after the endangerment finding or do some type of workaround, it shows they don't believe science, they don't care about public health and they obviously don't care about the climate crisis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Methane contributes to about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. but is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping the earth's heat, according to estimates used by the EPA. Agency figures show the oil-and-gas industry has long been a leading emitter, even before a drilling boom during the last decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The EPA's ongoing rule change seizes on Clean Air Act language that requires the agency to regulate when it determines an industrial activity \"causes, or contributes significantly to\" dangerous air pollution, according to the draft obtained by the Journal. It says the law's definition of significant is ambiguous, and that the EPA should set formal criteria to define it for both pollutants and their sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This promotes regulatory certainty for stakeholders and consistency in the EPA's identification of which air pollutants to regulate and reduces the risk that air pollutants that do not merit regulation will nevertheless become subject to regulation due to an unduly vague standard,\" the methane rule says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because climate change is a global problem, the EPA could set a test that makes \"significant\" a high bar for any greenhouse gas. Their emissions come from diverse sources all over the world. While the U.S. in total is a leading emitter world-wide, the emissions from any one domestic industrial sector could pale in comparison to global emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agency has been using climate modeling to explore its strategy, one senior administration official said. It shows that limiting emissions from almost any U.S. industrial sector won't change global temperatures from what is expected in 2050, even measuring out to the sixth decimal place, the official added. This person expects no source would pass the test for new regulation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One obstacle for the administration is it has already failed in one attempt to get this type of argument on greenhouse-gas emissions through the courts. A similar claim from the administration drew scorn just weeks ago from a U.S. District Court judge in Northern California, who went on to vacate its attempt to undo a parallel methane policy at the Interior Department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Framing sources as less than 1% of global emissions is dishonest and a prescription for climate disaster,\" wrote Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in a decision highly critical of the administration on several fronts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Timothy Puko\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

But to squeeze a living from it today, she and her husband need to do more than sell the milk from their herd of cows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So they carpeted the roofs of their farm buildings with solar panels. And thanks to hefty government guarantees, what they earn from selling electricity is \u201csafe money, not like cows,\u201d Ms. Zinnecker said. \u201cMilk prices go up and down.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The farm has been a beneficiary of \u201cEnergiewende,\u201d the German word for energy transition. Over the past two decades, Germany has focused its political will and treasure on a world-leading effort to wean its powerful economy off the traditional energy sources blamed for climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits of the program have not been universally felt, however. A de facto class system has emerged, saddling a group of have-nots with higher electricity bills that help subsidize the installation of solar panels and wind turbines elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Germany has spent an estimated 189 billion euros, or about $222 billion, since 2000 on renewable energy subsidies. But emissions have been stuck at roughly 2009 levels, and rose last year, as coal-fired plants fill a void left by Germany\u2019s decision to abandon nuclear power. That has raised questions \u2014 and anger \u2014 over a program meant to make the country\u2019s power sector greener.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This lack of progress is an \u201cillustration of the partial failure of the energy transition,\u201d said Artur Lenkowski, an energy analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm. \u201cThe whole point of the energy transition was to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, Energiewende is at a crossroads. Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term as Germany\u2019s leader after elections last month , but her party lost sway. She must form a coalition with the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Liberals, parties that have diametrically opposing views, including on environmental policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How such a diverse group comes together will affect whether Germany reaches its goal for carbon emissions. It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allg\u00e4u, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker\u2019s family-owned farm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around \u20ac40 million has been invested over the years \u2014 much of it by residents \u2014 into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>G\u00fcnter M\u00f6gele, Wildpoldsried\u2019s deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village\u2019s decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents\u2019 shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These big increases \u201care absolutely not O.K.,\u201d said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The higher prices have had political consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an \u201cimmediate exit\u201d from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a \u201cburden\u201d on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program\u2019s mounting costs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Julian Hermneuw\u00f6hner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuw\u00f6hner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional \u20ac800 a year because of Energiewende.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cBut it hasn\u2019t brought lower CO2 emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019re paying so much more, because the country hasn\u2019t gotten anything for it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that progress has been undone somewhat by the government\u2019s decision to accelerate its phase out of nuclear power after the 2011 disaster in Fukushima, Japan. That has made the country more reliant on its sizable fleet of coal-fired power stations, which account for the bulk of emissions from electricity generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The country has yet to address the transport industry , where emissions have increased as the economy boomed and more cars and trucks hit the road. Unlike Britain and \n France , Germany has not set a date to end \n the sale of diesel and gasoline cars .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent political experience does not bode well for Germany. The so-called grand coalition between Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which governed from 2013 until the recent elections, was bogged down with so many competing interests that it was unable to push ahead on energy policy .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects \u2014 though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cSome of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,\u201d said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIt is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow Stanley Reed on Twitter: @stanleyreed12 .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Saturday with an article about challenges facing Germany\u2019s clean energy industry misspelled the surname of a farmer in Betzigau, Germany, who, with his wife, has installed solar panels on his property.

The Obama administration plans to remedy this situation by drafting rules that would curtail these discharges from existing plants. The president should make sure they are tough. Nothing he can do will cut greenhouse gases more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By accomplishing this under the executive authority Congress granted him in the Clean Air Act, the president will be stepping in where recent Congresses have refused to go. He did the same thing last August, when he toughened auto emissions standards that will result in a new car fleet that averages 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, and again last spring, when he proposed rules, restricting carbon dioxide emissions, that will effectively prevent the building of new coal-burning power plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now President Obama should require existing power plants to reduce their emissions by at least one-quarter by 2020. These plants emitted 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2011, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, so a 25 percent cut would result in a reduction of more than 500 million tons. This would reduce lung-related illness and premature deaths, slow the accumulation of climate-changing gases in the atmosphere and demonstrate to the rest of the world that the United States was serious about taking on global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To achieve these reductions, the rules should favor making homes, buildings and power plants more energy efficient over the more costly conversion of coal-fired plants to natural gas. (Gas-fired power plants emit half as much carbon dioxide as coal-fired plants. But expanding energy efficiency will reduce electricity demand and eliminate the need for the coal plants. Closing them is better than converting them to gas.) The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says the technology exists now to cut electricity use by one-quarter by 2020 through efficiency alone. Based on the average electricity production of the nation\u2019s large coal-fired power plants, this would allow for the closing of close to 60 such plants across the nation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, the coal and utility industries won\u2019t take this lying down. Some coal mines may be closed, and the electric industry will be reconfigured. A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated recently that reducing emissions by at least one-quarter over the next seven years would cost $4 billion in compliance expenses in 2020. But the reduced hospitalizations and fewer days of work lost to illness, and other health and environmental benefits would save $25 billion to $60 billion, the study said. The approach would also stimulate investments of more than $90 billion in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, according to the analysis for the N.R.D.C. by the consulting firm ICF International.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The progression to using less coal will create new jobs to build the highly efficient appliances, wind turbines, solar farms and other technologies that capture renewable energy. In addition, jobs will be created as some states and utilities choose to comply by building natural gas power plants, which should be done only if they won\u2019t cause environmental havoc.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The auto industry is beginning to show how strong emissions standards and the technological advances they stimulate can benefit employment. When the new rules were announced last summer, Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers, predicted that they would require \u201cmore engineers and more factory workers, expanding employment in the industry.\u201d And Ford, which had already doubled its team working on fuel-saving engineering, said it planned to redouble the unit in 2015. Indeed, last week, Ford announced that it was adding 450 jobs at its Brook Park, Ohio, plant to produce its EcoBoost engine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not everyone will benefit immediately, of course. As demand for coal drops, some miners will lose their jobs. The nation owes them economic support, job training and sustainable jobs. There is a precedent for this: the government established a fund to help workers at nuclear weapons plants move to new jobs as the cold war ended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even as we reduce power plant pollution, we will need to do more to protect the atmosphere. We should also reduce emissions of such short-lived contributors to global warming as methane by tightening up leaky natural gas systems, and hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air-conditioning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, we must meet our energy needs largely without coal, oil or gas. We must use energy more efficiently to lower demand to the point that ramped-up clean, renewable energy supplies most of what we require.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By ordering the new auto emissions standards, Mr. Obama took an enormous step in the fight against global warming. In a similarly bold move, he can reduce our reliance on coal, a dirty fuel that is the greatest contributor to the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution. By setting stringent power plant standards, he will slow global warming at a fraction of the cost of ignoring it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel F.

That's because, in its view, most of Alberta's oil will find a way to get to the market anyway -- if not by pipeline, then by rail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the high end, the review concludes, blocking all proposed future pipelines out of Alberta would cut tar sands production 2 to 4 percent and have the same climate impact as taking one million cars off the road by 2030. That's the equivalent of about 0.07 percent of current U.S. emissions. (Other environmental groups have argued that the climate impacts could be six times as large.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, this report is not a final approval of the pipeline. Next up, there's a 45-day public comment period for the environmental review. Then the State Department will have to determine whether the pipeline is in America's national interest. Finally, President Obama has to decide whether to approve it or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, this is a key step in the process. Here are five key points from today's report:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1) Oil from the tar sands produces 17 percent more greenhouse-gas emissions over its life-cycle than regular oil. As such, the State Department points out that the pipeline could increase overall carbon pollution -- if it leads to a major expansion of Canada's tar-sands production. That, in turn, would worsen global warming. So that brings us to the key question</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2) The State Department thinks blocking the Keystone pipeline would have only a small impact on tar-sands production and climate change. If Canada can't find an outlet for its oil, there will be less production. So what happens if Keystone XL gets blocked? A lot depends on whether other pipelines get built, such as a proposed project through British Columbia -- as well as how much oil can be shipped profitably by rail instead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department considered two scenarios. First, if the Keystone pipeline is blocked, and other proposed pipelines go forward, tar sands production in Alberta \"could decrease by approximately 0.4 to 0.6 percent\" by 2030. A fairly small drop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alternatively, if Keystone XL was blocked and all of the proposed pipeline capacity out of Alberta were restricted, then tar sands production would drop by 2 to 4 percent by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a real dip, albeit a small one. In that second scenario, we would see a decrease of somewhere between 0.07 to 5.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030. At the high end, that would be like taking one million cars off the road. But that's also equivalent to just 0.07 percent of current U.S. emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists, for their part, are hotly disputing this section of the review, arguing that blocking Keystone would deal a much bigger, crippling blow to the tar sands. \"Canadian tar sands exports are blocked to the west by tribes that won't sell out their natural resources to Big Oil, and blocked to the east by the European Union's declaration that it won't buy dirty tar sands oil,\" said Jim Lyon of the National Wildlife Federation. \"Without access to major U.S. export terminals from Keystone XL and other routes, tar sands production will be substantially slowed.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3) If the Keystone XL pipeline is blocked, rail transport could make up most of the difference. \"Rail and supporting non-pipeline modes should be capable of providing the capacity needed to transport all incremental Western Canadian and Bakken crude oil production to markets if there were no additional pipeline projects approved.\" Elsewhere, Robert Bryce has explained how rail companies will deliver oil if the pipeline gets blocked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4) A pipeline spill is \"very unlikely\" to affect the key Ogallala Aquifer. The Ogallala Aquifer in the Midwest is one of the key freshwater sources for the Great Plains. So there's plenty of justifiable worry about running the Keystone pipeline through this area, given the potential for leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the State Department's not overly concerned about this: \"Overall, it is very unlikely that the proposed pipeline area would affect water quality in the [Great Plains Area] due to weak downward gradients (downward groundwater flows) in the aquifers overlying the [Great Plains Area].\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5) The Keystone XL project, if built, would support 42,000 jobs over its two-year construction period. \"Including direct, indirect, and induced effects, the proposed Project would potentially support approximately 42,100 average annual jobs across the United States over a 1-to 2-year construction period (of which, approximately 3,900 would be directly employed in construction activities).\" As with all construction projects, these jobs would be temporary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related:Just how dirty are Canada's oil sands, anyway?\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The effects of climate change are happening much faster than many of us expected. A Washington Post analysis of more than a century of temperature data across the Lower 48 states found that in some major areas climate change is already here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Snow melts more quickly, lakes that once froze don't do so as often, and weeds and insects that ordinarily would die in the cold don't, according to The Post report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We need to get moving. Instead, the nation seems more divided and in conflict than it has been in decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2014, the National Capital Planning Commission released a report outlining the challenges posed by climate change. Cooperation is the key.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The neighborhoods of the Washington, DC region are at risk of losing their strength and vitality due to changes in climate that may cause serious disruptions to public transportation, flood homes and parks, and reduce the economic vigor of the area,\" the report said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To meet the challenges, we'll need strong social networks. Transportation infrastructure needs strengthening. Metrorail has got to be more reliable. We need more trees. Better ways to collect rainwater, like rooftop gardens. We need solar power instead of being so reliant on outdated electrical grids. We need ways to prevent basement flooding and mitigate the health hazards of mold and mildew.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We still don't have a reliable way to evacuate the nation's capital in an emergency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is much work to be done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need to gain consensus on our collective risks and what we consider to be acceptable risks,\" the report said. \"The problem is not just about technology; it is a people and systems problem.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it even realistic to think that the leadership skills needed to help solve such problems exists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015, President Barack Obama's national security team issued a report, saying, \"Climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many people did respond with a certain kind of urgency. Gun sales skyrocketed at the mention of the threat to security. Warnings that climate change could cause food and water shortages drove others to stockpile those basics in addition to the guns and ammunition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In February, Daniel Coats, then director of national intelligence under President Trump, echoed the Obama administration warnings during testimony before a Senate subcommittee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security,\" Coats said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's response?

Its plant life constantly absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and returns oxygen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But deforestation and climate change may soon lead to a permanent change in the region\u2019s climate, scientists warn. The rainforest would be eroded past the point at which it can produce enough rainfall to sustain itself. More forest would die out, further reducing rainfall, in a self-reinforcing feedback loop of self-destruction that, once begun, might not be possible to stop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before long, much of the world\u2019s largest rainforest could disappear, receding into a vast savanna.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would be a terrible loss in its own right, stripping the world of much of its biodiversity, and more broadly, a climate disaster without an equivalent in world history. The region would cease to absorb climate-warming carbon dioxide and, in the process, release up to six times the annual carbon output of every coal-burning plant on earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I first wrote about dieback, as this phenomenon is known, in 2019. That year, Thomas Lovejoy, a prominent environmental scientist, told me the scenario was \u201cclose. It\u2019s really close.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He added, \u201cAnd it can happen in a very short period of time.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two years later, a series of alarming events and scientific findings suggest that the warnings may soon, or even now, be coming to pass.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you look at the current weather patterns,\u201d Dr. Lovejoy told me this week, \u201cit looks to me like the tipping point is here and now.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How does dieback happen?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists began to document the process in the 2010s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In one experiment, researchers found that if they subjected a plot of rainforest to small fires over several years, and if rainfall also declined, then something snapped. The proportion of plant life that died after a single fire spiked from about 5 to 60 percent \u2014 ecological death.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fires, it turned out, had burned out much of the dense forest floor, which normally acts as a break on fire. Invasive grasses filled in, providing fuel for future fires. Fires also thinned the trees, allowing future fires to burn faster and hotter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a drop in rainfall was the crucial ingredient. It slowed regrowth, keeping the plot sparse. And it dried out those invasive grasses, turning the forest floor into a layer of fast-burning kindling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Years of development in the Amazon have effectively reproduced this experiment on an enormous scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fires, many set deliberately to convert rainforest into farmland, have thinned much of the rainforest, while also allowing invasive grasses to rush in. Roads and other construction have also bifurcated the rainforest, thinning it out and exposing forest edges that dry easily and make for especially potent firespreaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this happens in a large enough area, it can severely reduce rainfall \u2014 creating the conditions that led to sudden ecological death in the fire study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Normally, plant life absorbs rainwater and groundwater, then sweats it back out into the atmosphere as moisture, seeding more rain. Less forest means less rain. Possibly a lot less.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change exacerbates every part of this cycle. It is shortening the rainy season and raising temperatures. Forests are drier and thinner. The tipping point, past which the rainforest can no longer produce enough rain to keep itself healthy, is much easier to reach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This process can take on a momentum all its own. And it is thought to naturally spread. As one area experiences dieback, neighboring rainforest becomes more exposed while also seeing rainfall drop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe models, and they\u2019re pretty consistent,\u201d Dr. Lovejoy said in 2019, \u201csuggest that the combination of fire and climate change and deforestation will weaken the hydrological cycle of the Amazon to the point where you just get insufficient rainfall in the south and the east, and then part of the central Amazon, to actually support a rainforest.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is dieback happening now?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the last two years, Dr. Lovejoy said, signs of this process have accumulated. Rainfall is down, he said, and temperatures are rising.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He cited a 20 percent drop in corn production as a particularly worrying indicator. Past research has identified corn as especially sensitive to environmental changes from deforestation and climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amazon deforestation has been accelerating, indicating that there may be more than fires at work. Last year, the rate of deforestation increased 12 percent from 2019, which was already a catastrophic year for the Amazon. And it may be increasing further. Brazilian government figures show record rates of month-by-month deforestation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even more worrying, parts of the Amazon have already flipped from net absorbers of carbon dioxide to net emitters, according to research released last month. It is an indicator that the process may already be beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What does it mean for the world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The potential loss of the Amazon rainforest would provide not one but two of the greatest accelerants to climate change since the industrial revolution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, it would significantly reduce the rate at which the earth naturally converts carbon dioxide back into oxygen. It would be as if the amount of carbon produced by factories and cars suddenly shot up worldwide, simply because there was less to counterbalance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, the process of deforestation itself deposits shocking amounts of carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rainforest is estimated to store about 100 billion tons of carbon as plant matter. When that matter burns, the carbon gets released into the atmosphere. That\u2019s nearly seven times the amount of carbon emitted by every coal plant worldwide in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Replacing much of the Amazon rainforest with a hot, dry savanna would also devastate one of the world\u2019s largest centers of unique plant and animal species as well as many Indigenous communities. The knock-on ecological effects are hard to anticipate, but nobody thinks they would be good \u2014 or limited to South America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency situation,\u201d Adriane Esquivel Muelbert, a University of Birmingham ecologist, told the scientific journal Nature last year. \u201cWe can fix this, but we need to act now.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel Nepstad, an environmental scientist who studies the Amazon, told me this week, \u201cI am worried by fatalistic responses to these new discoveries \u2014 the sense of resignation that there is nothing we can do to manage the forest dieback. There is actually a lot that we can do.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He added: \u201cAmazon forests are tenacious. Give them a chance \u2014 protect them from fire \u2014 and they come charging back.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Dr. Lovejoy and others, the answer is difficult but obvious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cTime to act,\u201d he said, defining that action with one word: \u201cReforest.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What We\u2019re Reading</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cDemocracy and the Market,\u201d the seminal and still-relevant 1991 book on how modern democracy comes about and survives (or doesn\u2019t), by the scholar Adam Przeworski.

Suggs, an activist and University of North Carolina sophomore from eastern North Carolina, and Lindsay Cooper, a recent college graduate and policy analyst for Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who are both from regions recently pelted with intense hurricanes and subsequent flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They also include Aji Piper, one of 21 plaintiffs, now ages 10 to 21, in a\u00a0high-profile case against the federal government for allegedly violating their constitutional rights by promoting fossil fuels and forcing them later in life to live in a warming world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Like youth who have come before us in the civil rights movement and other social justice movements,\"\u00a0Piper told lawmakers, \"it is often the young among us that shine the light on systems of injustice.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats held the hearing as lawmakers are preparing for the 2020 election. Turnout among young people will be key to Democrats' chances of retaking the White House or Senate, and retaining the House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also comes as students across dozens of U.S. states last month skipped school to protest inaction in addressing the causes or effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hearing, however, did not bring clarity to\u00a0what the sort of proposals the\u00a0climate committee will produce going forward. Castor has not announced the topic of the next hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, in an indication of how Democrats want to double down on the climate issue even after the recent\u00a0defeat of the Green New Deal in the Senate, Castor\u00a0said her committee will hold field hearings outside Washington in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike other environmental committees in the House, such as the Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources panels, the committee on the climate crisis is purely fact-finding. The other committees deal with actual legislation. This\u00a0year, other committees have held more than a dozen hearings on various facets of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, one of Castor's own bills \u2014 to prevent the United States from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord \u2014 was advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Republicans accused Democrats of ramming through that legislation, formally introduced just at the end of March,\u00a0without any hearings despite promises from Democrats to return to regular order.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The committee did not hold a single hearing on the details and effect of the legislation,\" Rep. Greg Walden (Ore.), top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said during a hearing. \"Stakeholders have not had the ability to weigh in on the impacts of this bill.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), a high-ranking\u00a0Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel, countered that Castor's bill committing the country to the Paris agreement was a \"straightforward issue.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There was a push to move forward aggressively because we lost 10 years,\" he added in an interview Thursday. \"We lost a lot of time.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, at least some Republicans, who collectively have\u00a0been reluctant or outright hostile to having discussions about climate change in the past, have been more open this Congress to addressing the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That shift was on display at Thursday's hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have an opportunity to make progress on this issue,\" said the top Republican on the select climate panel, Garret Graves (La.), while emphasizing the loss of coastline in his state and his desire for \"logical solutions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 David Bernhardt's nomination approved by Senate panel: The former energy and water\u00a0lobbyist is one step closer to becoming Interior secretary. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 14 to 6 to approve Bernhardt's nomination on Thursday, with several Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), joining the 11 Republican members voting to make him the permanent leader of the department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Bernhardt's ability to manage those resources without bias toward the oil industry and water utilities he once represented was questioned by skeptical Democrats on the committee as well as conservationists,\" The Post's Darryl Fears reports, adding that the Thursday vote \"reflected little of the contentious questioning of Bernhardt during a confirmation hearing the week before.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Another request for another investigation into Bernhardt:\u00a0Just before the vote, a group of eight Senate Democrats\u00a0called\u00a0on Interior's internal watchdog to investigate Bernhardt's role in blocking the release of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analysis on pesticides and endangered species. It's the second such letter Senate Democrats have sent to the\u00a0inspector general's office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Another Iowa Republican chimes in on\u00a0Trump's wind turbine remarks:\u00a0Sen. Joni Ernst called\u00a0the president's remarks this week that noise from wind turbines cause cancer\u00a0\"ridiculous.\" She continued: \"I have church bells that ring all the time across from my office here in D.C. and I know that noise doesn't give me cancer, otherwise I'd have 'church bell cancer,'\" Ernst said,\u00a0according\u00a0to Iowa's WHO TV. Ernst called wind energy a \"tremendous asset\" for her state. The state's other senator,\u00a0Charles E. Grassley (R), similarly called Trump's remarks \"idiotic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Interior reverses effort limit oil and gas development in Montana: After a federal court ruled to reinstate drilling leases on public land bordering Glacier National Park that had been canceled by the Interior Department in 2016 and 2017, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a Montana native, had planned to appeal the rulings. But the department this week filed\u00a0an intent to withdraw its appeal of one case, the Missoulian reports. It is an indication of an end to the relative cautiousness at Interior of developing Montana while it was being run by Zinke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 NOAA plan would let Washington tribe hunt gray whales again: A new proposal from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would grant the Makah tribe in the state of Washington the ability to resume hunting gray whales. The tribe last legally hunted gray whales in 1999. \"But subsequent hunts were mired in lawsuits and administrative procedures,\" the Seattle Times reports. \"Further controversy erupted after five Makah tribal members illegally hunted and killed a gray whale on Sept. 8, 2007.\" NOAA's proposal includes a limited 10-year hunting waiver and would require the tribe to get a permit from the agency before any hunt. The proposal would also limit the tribe to killing no more than three whales per year in even numbered years and one whale per year in odd-numbered ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Expect an \"average\" hurricane season: The Colorado State University's hurricane research team has released its initial predictions for the upcoming season.

No U.S.-only initiative can stop the planet from warming. Any effective response to climate change will require broad, international effort.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All true. But such coordination is not as out of reach as many believe. It is quite possible -- if the United States does its part.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The European Union has been shrinking its carbon footprint for years, proof that the United States will not be cutting emissions alone. A 2013 study of 33 major nations found a broad move toward environmental protection in places such as Japan, Mexico and South Korea. Developed nations alone can have a noticeable effect: A Council of Economic Advisers study last month noted that the climate-change response will be a lot less expensive if developed countries start now and others catch up than if no one starts now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But large developing countries can and should be expected to act, too. At the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, China agreed to moderate but serious reductions in its economy's carbon intensity -- how much carbon dioxide it produces for every unit of gross domestic product -- a result possible only because President Obama brought a carbon-cutting pledge to the table. If countries merely sustain their Copenhagen commitments, that alone will bend the global emissions curve down, a 2013 MIT analysis found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since Copenhagen, China has offered a mixed picture, not confirmation that it will do nothing. The country has built coal-fired plants, but its rulers are also investing in nuclear power, experimenting with carbon pricing and emphasizing environmental considerations with increasing urgency. The government has little choice; air quality in the north has become a noxious social problem, and China faces a variety of climate risks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next year, international negotiators will meet in Paris. They will bring their national contributions, already vetted at home, to the conference and bundle them together. This system may not drive down emissions as quickly as the top-down treaty of activists' dreams. But it is achievable, and the pledges will be more reliable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts at MIT and elsewhere anticipate that some countries, such as India and South Africa, will bring little to the table but that China will expand on its previous commitments. Added to others' pledges, backed by efforts already underway, this would move the global emissions curve down more, heading off catastrophic high-emissions scenarios. Even so, the emissions trajectory would still be above the path scientists recommend to keep global temperature rise moderate. In other words, sustained, contentious diplomatic effort will be required after Paris. The United States must be a driver; no country has pumped more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, and no global effort will succeed without U.S. buy-in and leadership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In trade agreements, other environmental accords and arms-reduction pacts, countries have shown they can overcome mutual suspicion when cooperation offers clear, long-term benefits. A U.S. commitment would offer other countries confidence that the United States will jump with them -- and allow U.S. diplomats to isolate laggards. Congress can help: Putting a price on U.S. carbon emissions, and applying a charge on imports from countries without a strong anti-emissions policy, would give China and others an incentive to implement plans of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world will not give up fossil fuels tomorrow -- or many years from tomorrow. The transition scientists recommend will be slow, and the world may have to adapt to risks it did not have enough sense to avoid. But pointing out the difficulty of the problem is not a strategy. It is an excuse to shrink from one of history's greatest challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

But that's the unfortunate position that our financial system is in as it faces increasing challenges from climate change. It's time for the financial system to wake up to the threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the most politically polarized issue, climate change rarely finds total agreement. So many were likely surprised recently when representatives of oil companies, agribusinesses, banks, retirement funds and environmental organizations, plus some academics like me, jointly authored and unanimously endorsed a government report calling out the risks of climate change to the U.S. financial system. Working together for the top U.S. regulatory agency for derivatives, we wrote that climate change poses an important threat, and the financial system needs to get ready. And we provided dozens of recommendations for what can be done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a lot to fix. For one thing, our government needs to limit the scale of the problem going forward. Dumping climate pollution into the atmosphere is currently free. There needs to be a cost of disrupting our climate. Our legislators need to put a price on carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, our government regulators need to be aware of and prioritize the climate-related risks to the financial system. These risks need to be better quantified, and more transparent to investors, so they can be priced appropriately.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change poses a variety of threats related to commodities like crops and fossil fuels, as well as to real estate and other economic sectors. In the Midwest, we regularly see crops ruined by droughts or floods. We expect wetter springs, bigger downpours and more variable precipitation during hotter summers to crash yields more often. The agricultural banks that many farmers depend on for credit are typically small and disproportionately exposed to these regional extreme weather events. If droughts and floods that threaten farmers' livelihoods also degrade their banks' ability to provide credit, recovery from these events will be even more difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recently, climate-related threats to homes and properties have become painfully obvious on our coasts. In the West, wildfires have grown in size, with terrible consequences. In the East and South, more powerful and wetter hurricanes, pushing storm surges on top of a higher ocean and gulf, have flooded and torn apart homes and businesses. The insurance sector is already reacting to these changing threats; its regulators need to help companies assess their exposure in a transparent and comparable manner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The primary climate risk to the oil, gas and coal industries is that society will take our advice and add the full cost of climatic disruption to the price of fossil fuels. Such a price increase would incentivize companies and individuals to use less of these fuels. A reduction in demand would depress the values of fossil fuels, their discovered but untapped reserves, and the companies that participate in this sector. This risk needs to be clearly quantified for investors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's relatively easy to see how individual events such as floods or fires can affect individual commodities, sectors or even a region. However, the financial system must see how ongoing changes can connect through the market to more broadly threaten its ability to function. For instance, sea-level rise could reduce coastal home values, reducing cities' tax bases and their capacity to make payments on municipal bonds (which may have paid for flood control measures to begin with). Bond defaults are a threat that we want our financial system to manage. But how can it do this if it doesn't see the problem coming?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The risks related to climate change need to be clear to those who put money in the game. Investors, whether they are buying crop futures, municipal bonds, corporate debt or stock in insurance or energy companies, must be able to evaluate their climate risk exposure. We need a commonly accepted level of climate risk that requires disclosure, and straightforward, comparable and fair methods for companies to determine this risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The system needs to be prepared for times when everything goes wrong at once. Aren't we learning this from 2020? Climate disruption increases the chance that the many different weather-related threats will get bigger, happen more often and happen at the same time. Each event is a disaster for many people, and a minor challenge to the financial system. But more and more often, economically damaging events will pile up on top of one another.

A breeze came off the North Saskatchewan River, rippling across rows of ripe wheat, but a caustic scent flooded his nose. An oil well between his crops and the river was leaking, and enough gas was flowing out of a pipe below the rusty pump jack that the farmer could smell gas and see it swirling in the air.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The site had been drilled in 1950 but hadn\u2019t run since 2015. It was now spewing a blend of toxic, egg-smelling hydrogen sulfide and, quite likely, a much larger dose of odorless, flammable methane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey said, \u2018don\u2019t get too close to it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Romaniuk said, referring to the owners of the well. He put the tractor in gear and skirted the edge of the site, hoping he wouldn\u2019t spark an explosion as he hurried to harvest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada has committed to reducing its planet-warming carbon emissions and has singled out the oil and gas industry as the source of almost half of the country\u2019s annual emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that can have 80 times the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide over 20 years. Alberta, the heart of Canadian hydrocarbon extraction, has set a goal of a 45 percent drop in the industry\u2019s methane footprint from active infrastructure by 2025. But the inactive wells \u2014 the ones no longer producing oil or natural gas but many still lingering in suspension like zombies \u2014 may be as big a threat to the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After decades of booms and busts, an enormous backlog of these inactive wells has built up, and it grows about 6 percent each year. There are now 97,920 wells, like the one on Mr. Romaniuk\u2019s land, that are licensed as temporarily suspended, compared to the province\u2019s 160,000 active wells. The inactive wells are unlikely to be switched on ever again but have not yet been decommissioned. No one knows how many are leaking methane and other pollutants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s been festering for decades,\u201d said Sonya Savage, Alberta\u2019s energy minister.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Alberta, the amount of methane and other potent greenhouse gases seeping from suspended wells has not been comprehensively studied. But research in British Columbia, another province with a long history of oil and gas development, revealed that more than a quarter of inactive wells in that province were leaking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The normal life cycle of an oil or gas well is a little like that of a human: It is brought into life with expectation, produces vibrantly for a time, steadily declines and then is buried under clean soil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alberta\u2019s oil boom started in earnest in the 1940s. The province was dotted with wells in the following decades, generating billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the price of oil crashed in the 1980s, thousands of wells quickly became unprofitable, and even though Alberta law places responsibility for closing those wells on the industry, many companies stopped taking care of the inactive wells. By 1990, there were more than 29,000 inactive wells in Alberta.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Alberta Energy Regulator, part of the Ministry of Energy, reacted in 1997 with a rule that required companies to close a well after ten years of inactivity. But the industry pushed back and, in 2000, the agency allowed wells to be indefinitely suspended instead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Depending on a well\u2019s concentration of hydrogen sulfide, its condition and its proximity to homes, suspension can be as simple as putting a chain on the valve handles or as complicated as installing a cast iron and rubber bridge plug deep in the ground. Once a well is suspended for longer than 10 years, the plug becomes mandatory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Alberta, unlike in other oil fields including British Columbia and North Dakota, there is no time limit on how long a well can be suspended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly 30,000 wells in Alberta that have been suspended for longer than ten years. According to the Alberta Energy Regulator, these wells are reactivated less than 0.2 percent of the time. One well near Calgary has been suspended since 1928.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>William Morin, chief of the Enoch Cree Nation, drove past a grove where medicine men sometimes harvest sweetgrass, berries and buffalo sage on his way to survey an empty oil tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhen oil and gas was produced in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, that\u2019s how this nation grew in capacity and off of government funding,\u201d Mr. Morin said, referring to the Enoch Cree Nation. \u201cBut then the oil and gas ran out.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Out of 274 wells on Enoch Cree land, only 34 are currently pumping. The others are inactive: 43 are suspended and the rest have been decommissioned with a plug and a cement cap, but in many cases, equipment and waste has been left behind. The Enoch Cree Nation is in the process of measuring gas emissions from inactive sites and plans to use an infrared camera to detect hidden flows. But not all leaks are hidden.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One suspended well, set in the woods only a few hundred feet from a home, was wafting the telltale rotten smell of hydrogen sulfide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, MAGA Energy, a new company, acquired the well when it purchased Cedar Creek Energy, a company with a tangled history that had been passed between several different owners. \u201cWe\u2019re at the tail end of the life on a lot of these properties,\u201d said Mark Ross, a vice president at the company, which has 20 employees and stands for \u201cMake Alberta Great Again.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Half of the wells are suspended, though the company hopes to make some active again by drilling horizontally into new production zones. They have started to close some suspended wells that have no chance of new production, but the price is high. Exactly how high is under debate, but most estimates dwarf the annual taxes and lease payments to leave a well in suspension even for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at 100,000 dollars expenditure for cleanup but the surface leases and the taxes in the meantime might be 3,000 dollars or 3,500 dollars,\u201d Mr. Ross said. (100,000 Canadian dollars is about $75,000.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This spring, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a 1.7 billion Canadian dollar fund to clean up inactive wells around the country as part of a coronavirus stimulus package for the oil and gas industry. Alberta\u2019s share of the program was the bulk: 1.2 billion dollars. So far, applications have been accepted to close 8,200 wells. But this still leaves more than 88,000 suspended wells.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as these wells age, the risk that they leak increases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wells plunge thousands of feet into the earth, with a concrete casing and steel piping that is meant to keep them isolated from the various layers of soil, rock and water that they pass through. But over time, all wells can erode, vulnerable to salty water, corrosive gas, earthquakes and other environmental changes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is little research on emissions from suspended wells in Alberta, and they are not included in a new methane monitoring program for active wells that started in January. Companies are supposed to measure leaks when they find them in suspended wells.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In neighboring British Columbia, 29 percent of inactive wells were leaking when John Werring, a science and policy adviser at the David Suzuki Foundation, an environmental organization, studied them in 2015. And even wells that have been sealed and decommissioned can leak: Between 2009 and 2014, the Alberta Energy Regulator measured leaks in 7.7 percent of wells that were already closed and sealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Savage, the Alberta energy minister, announced a policy in July to clean up suspended wells by requiring companies to spend 4 percent of their estimated cleanup costs per year on well closures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She mentioned that some companies were already meeting the spending requirement voluntarily.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But \u201csome are spending zero,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the ones where we do need to get their inventory cleaned up.\u201d However, she said, \u201cthose are the same companies that are hanging by, month to month, not sure if they can pay their electricity bills.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither Ms. Savage nor the Alberta Energy Regulator has a plan to ensure compliance from these companies, nor have they included timelines in the policy. Instead, the policy\u2019s environmental assessment builds on an existing process for landowners to register complaints about wells on their property. This may give farmers more of a voice but it also relies on citizens to police oil and gas companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is an injustice in enforcing regulations,\u201d said Karl Zajes, as he sat on his porch in the town of Warburg, looking out on his cattle. \u201cIf there was not, there would not be all these inactive wells.\u201d For 30 years, Mr. Zajes has been the president of the Warburg Pembina Surface Rights Group, representing landowners who face battles with the oil and gas industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A farmer may own his fields, but not what\u2019s beneath them. When an oil company acquires the mineral rights, the farmer must allow the company to drill through the property. In exchange, the company will produce a lease document that lays out annual compensation for the farmer for the loss of productivity on the land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s made for them, by them,\u201d Mr. Zajes said of the fossil fuel industry. The landowners are typically farmers, not lawyers, and so Mr. Zajes helps them navigate the lease process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The leak in the well on Mr. Romaniuk\u2019s land is not the first problem to crop up on the property. He fought for lease payments after one company went bankrupt and, a decade ago, his fields were exposed to a different gas leak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was a terrible smell,\u201d Mr. Romaniuk said. \u201cI was worried that my cattle might asphyxiate,\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAll gas wells vent,\u201d said Noreen Sumara, the health, safety and environment manager at Long Run Energy, the company that owns the well. She said that the new leak did not pose an environmental or human risk. \u201cWe\u2019re following all regulations,\u201d Ms. Sumara said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current flow from the rusty pump jack on Mr. Romaniuk\u2019s land is not included in the Alberta Energy Regulator database, which is self-reported by the companies. The well sits in the field, at the end of its life yet still uncapped and unburied, leaking.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that continued greenhouse gas emissions \"would cause further warming\" and induce changes that could \"occur in all regions of the globe . . . and include changes in land and ocean, in the water cycle, in the cryosphere, in sea level . . . and in ocean acidification.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six years ago, in its last report, the IPCC concluded that there was a 90 percent certainty that human activity was responsible for most of Earth's warming. The 2013 draft summary increased that certainty to 95 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global surface temperature from 1951-2010,\" the report said. \"There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level, and changed some climate extremes, in the second half of the 20th century.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The IPCC -- composed of hundreds of scientists, including from federal agencies -- tracks the impact of global warming on specific regions and species and won a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with former vice president Al Gore. The body plans to release its massive final report in four stages over the next year, starting with a meeting next month in Stockholm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The draft summary, completed in June, was leaked and first reported last weekend by the Reuters news service and later by the New York Times. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the draft Tuesday afternoon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In remarks to the British Broadcasting Corp., a spokesman said that the report is far from complete and that conclusions should not be drawn from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It is guaranteed it will change,\" said Jonathan Lynn, spokesman for the IPCC. He said the document was provided to U.N. member governments and has drawn 1,800 comments, many of which will be considered as the assessment is debated and edited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the leaked draft mirrors previous assessments in many ways, and asserts that its changed predictions are the result of significant improvements in the way scientists study the rise in temperature and sea levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some say the draft's predictions are too conservative. The prediction that ocean levels could rise as much as three feet by the end of the century conflicts with those of other scientists who envision even more dire consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report on Maryland sea-level rise released in June by the state'sClimate Change Commission estimated that the rise would range from slightly less than a foot to two feet by 2050, and from two to six feet by 2100, depending on several factors, including glacial ice melt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Up to six feet of sea-level rise can be devastating when effects from storm surge are factored in, said Donald F. Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to projections, the document reported several facts. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by more than 20 percent since 1958 and 40 percent since 1750, \"virtually all due to burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, and a small contribution from cement production.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, climate change will continue for centuries even if emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. \"This represents a substantial multi-century commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, called the draft a sober snapshot of how climate science has evolved since the last report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Scientists have a clearer picture of how our climate is changing,\" she said. The bad news: \"The problem is getting worse because countries keep dumping more heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ekwurzel said this draft has a more realistic estimate for global sea-level rise than the last report. Still, scientists are estimating a far more rapid sea-level rise \"for planners in places like the East Coast.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>darryl.fears@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

In the aftermath, her husband died and she became so destitute that she sold her son and daughter into bonded servitude. And she may lose yet more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Khatun now lives in a bamboo shack that sits below sea level about 50 yards from a sagging berm. She spends her days collecting cow dung for fuel and struggling to grow vegetables in soil poisoned by salt water. Climate scientists predict that this area will be inundated as sea levels rise and storm surges increase, and a cyclone or another disaster could easily wipe away her rebuilt life. But Ms. Khatun is trying to hold out at least for a while \u2014 one of millions living on borrowed time in this vast landscape of river islands, bamboo huts, heartbreaking choices and impossible hopes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the world\u2019s top scientists meet in Yokohama, Japan, this week, at the top of the agenda is the prediction that global sea levels could rise more than three feet by 2100. Higher seas and warmer weather will cause profound changes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate scientists have concluded that widespread burning of fossil fuels is releasing heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet. While this will produce a host of effects, the most worrisome may be the melting of much of the earth\u2019s ice, which is likely to raise sea levels and flood coastal regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such a rise will be uneven because of gravitational effects and human intervention, so predicting its outcome in any one place is difficult. But island nations like the Maldives, Kiribati and Fiji may lose much of their land area, and millions of Bangladeshis will be displaced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere are a lot of places in the world at risk from rising sea levels, but Bangladesh is at the top of everybody\u2019s list,\u201d said Rafael Reuveny, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University at Bloomington. \u201cAnd the world is not ready to cope with the problems.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The effects of climate change have led to a growing sense of outrage in developing nations, many of which have contributed little to the pollution that is linked to rising temperatures and sea levels but will suffer the most from the consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At a climate conference in Warsaw in November, there was an emotional outpouring from countries that face existential threats, among them Bangladesh, which produces just 0.3 percent of the emissions driving climate change. Some leaders have demanded that rich countries compensate poor countries for polluting the atmosphere. A few have even said that developed countries should open their borders to climate migrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of global justice,\u201d said Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies and the nation\u2019s leading climate scientist. \u201cThese migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>River deltas around the globe are particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising seas, and wealthier cities like London, Venice and New Orleans also face uncertain futures. But it is the poorest countries with the biggest populations that will be hit hardest, and none more so than Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated nations in the world. In the Ganges Delta, made up of 230 major rivers and streams, 160 million people live in a place one-fifth the size of France and as flat as chapati, the bread served at almost every meal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Perilous Position</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Bangladesh has contributed little to industrial air pollution, other kinds of environmental degradation have left it especially vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bangladesh relies almost entirely on groundwater for drinking supplies because the rivers are so polluted. The resultant pumping causes the land to settle. So as sea levels are rising, Bangladesh\u2019s cities are sinking, increasing the risks of flooding. Poorly constructed seawalls compound the problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The country\u2019s climate scientists and politicians have come to agree that by 2050, rising sea levels will inundate some 17 percent of the land and displace about 18 million people, Dr. Rahman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bangladeshis have already started to move away from the lowest-lying villages in the river deltas of the Bay of Bengal, scientists in Bangladesh say. People move for many reasons, and urbanization is increasing across South Asia, but rising tides are a big factor. Dr. Rahman\u2019s research group has made a rough estimate from small surveys that as many as 1.5 million of the five million slum inhabitants in Dhaka, the capital, moved from villages near the Bay of Bengal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The slums that greet them in Dhaka are also built on low-lying land, making them almost as vulnerable to being inundated as the land villagers left behind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Khatun and her neighbors have lived through deadly cyclones \u2014 a synonym here for hurricane \u2014 and have seen the salty rivers chew through villages and poison fields. Rising seas are increasingly intruding into rivers, turning fresh water brackish. Even routine flooding then leaves behind salt deposits that can render land barren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making matters worse, much of what the Bangladeshi government is doing to stave off the coming deluge \u2014 raising levees, dredging canals, pumping water \u2014 deepens the threat of inundation in the long term, said John Pethick, a former professor of coastal science at Newcastle University in England who has spent much of his retirement studying Bangladesh\u2019s predicament. Rich nations are not the only ones to blame, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an analysis of decades of tidal records published in October, Dr. Pethick found that high tides in Bangladesh were rising 10 times faster than the global average. He predicted that seas in Bangladesh could rise as much as 13 feet by 2100, four times the global average. In an area where land is often a thin brown line between sky and river \u2014 nearly a quarter of Bangladesh is less than seven feet above sea level \u2014 such an increase would have dire consequences, Dr. Pethick said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe reaction among Bangladeshi government officials has been to tell me that I must be wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable, but it also means they have no hope of preparing themselves.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Rahman said that he did not disagree with Dr. Pethick\u2019s findings, but that no estimate was definitive. Other scientists have predicted more modest rises. For example, Robert E. Kopp, an associate director of the Rutgers Energy Institute at Rutgers University, said that data from nearby Kolkata, India, suggested that seas in the region could rise five to six feet by 2100.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is no doubt that preparations within Bangladesh have been utterly inadequate, but any such preparations are bound to fail because the problem is far too big for any single government,\u201d said Tariq A. Karim, Bangladesh\u2019s ambassador to India. \u201cWe need a regional and, better yet, a global solution. And if we don\u2019t get one soon, the Bangladeshi people will soon become the world\u2019s problem, because we will not be able to keep them.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Karim estimated that as many as 50 million Bangladeshis would flee the country by 2050 if sea levels rose as expected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Losing Everything</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, signs of erosion are everywhere in the Ganges Delta \u2014 the world\u2019s largest delta, which empties much of the water coming from the Himalayas. There are brick foundations torn in half, palm trees growing out of rivers and rangy cattle grazing on island pastures the size of putting greens. Fields are dusted white with salt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even without climate change, Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable places in the world to bad weather: The V-shaped Bay of Bengal funnels cyclones straight into the country\u2019s fan-shaped coastline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some scientists believe that rising temperatures will lead to more extreme weather worldwide, including stronger and more frequent cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. And rising seas will make any storm more dangerous because flooding will become more likely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bangladesh has done much to protect its population by creating an early-warning system and building at least 2,500 concrete storm shelters. The result has been a vast reduction in storm-related deaths. While Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed as many as 550,000 people, Cyclone Aila in 2009 killed 300. The deadliest part of the storm was the nearly 10-foot wall of water that roared through villages in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The poverty of people like Ms. Khatun makes them particularly vulnerable to storms. When Aila hit, Ms. Khatun was home with her husband, parents and four children. A nearby berm collapsed, and their mud and bamboo hut washed away in minutes. Unable to save her belongings, Ms. Khatun put her youngest child on her back and, with her husband, fought through surging waters to a high road. Her parents were swept away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAfter about a kilometer, I managed to grab a tree,\u201d said Abddus Satter, Ms. Khatun\u2019s father. \u201cAnd I was able to help my wife grab on as well. We stayed on that tree for hours.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The couple eventually shifted to the roof of a nearby hut. The family reunited on the road the next day after the children spent a harrowing night avoiding snakes that had sought higher ground, too. They drank rainwater until rescuers arrived a day or two later with bottled water, food and other supplies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ordeal took a severe toll on Ms. Khatun\u2019s husband, whose health soon deteriorated. To pay for his treatment and the cost of rebuilding their hut, the family borrowed money from a loan shark. In return, Ms. Khatun and her three older children, then 10, 12 and 15, promised to work for seven months in a nearby brickmaking factory. She later sold her 11- and 13-year-old children to the owner of another brick factory, this one in Dhaka, for $450 to pay more debts. Her husband died four years after the storm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an interview, one of her sons, Mamun Sardar, now 14, said he worked from dawn to dusk carrying newly made bricks to the factory oven.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said he missed his mother, \u201cbut she lives far away.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Impossible Hopes</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Discussions about the effects of climate change in the Ganges Delta often become community events. In the village of Choto Jaliakhali, where Ms. Khatun lives, dozens of people said they could see that the river was rising. Several said they had been impoverished by erosion, which has cost many villagers their land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Muhammad Moktar Ali said he could not think about the next storm because all he had in the world was his hut and village. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to support ourselves if we lost this,\u201d he said, gesturing to his gathered neighbors. \u201cIt is God who will help us survive.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Surveys show that residents of the delta do not want to migrate, Dr. Rahman said. Moving to slums in already crowded cities is their least preferred option.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But cities have become the center of Bangladesh\u2019s textile industry, which is now the source of 80 percent of the country\u2019s exports, 45 percent of its industrial employment and 15 percent of its gross domestic product.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the weeks after the storm, the women of Dakope found firewood by wading into the raging river and pushing their toes into the muddy bottom. They walked hours to buy drinking water. After rebuilding the village\u2019s berm and their own hut, Shirin Aktar and her husband, Bablu Gazi, managed to get just enough of a harvest to survive from their land, which has become increasingly infertile from salt water. Some plots that once sustained three harvests can now support just one; others are entirely barren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After two hungry years, the couple gave up on farming and moved to Chittagong, Bangladesh\u2019s second-largest city, leaving their two children behind with Mr. Gazi\u2019s mother.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gazi found work immediately as a day laborer, mostly digging foundations. Ms. Aktar searched for a job as a seamstress, but headaches and other slum-induced health problems have so incapacitated her that the couple are desperate to return to Dakope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here for too long,\u201d Mr. Gazi said. \u201cIf we can save some money, then we\u2019ll go back. I\u2019ll work on a piece of land and try to make it fertile again.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the chances of finding fertile land in his home village, where the salty rivers have eaten away acre upon acre, are almost zero.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dozens of people gathered in the narrow mud alley outside Mr. Gazi\u2019s room as he spoke. Some told similar stories of storms, loss and hope, and many nodded as Mr. Gazi spoke of his dreams of returning to his doomed village.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAll of us came here because of erosions and cyclones,\u201d said Noakhali, a hollow-eyed 30-year-old with a single name who was wearing the traditional skirt of the delta. \u201cNot one of us actually wants to live here.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

Warming temperatures and melting ice have opened up the possibility of new shipping routes in the Arctic Sea as well as resource extraction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China's rare-earths giant Shenghe Resources Holding Co. and an Australian firm were on the cusp of developing a mine along the icebound island's southern coast when Greenland's government called a snap election amid mounting controversy over the project's impact on the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, Greenland's left-wing pro-environment party Inuit Ataqatigiit finished first in that election with 37% of the vote, paving the way for IA's 34-year-old leader, Mute Egede, to form a coalition government. The incumbent center-left party Siumut, meaning Forward, garnered only 29% of the vote after backing the mining project.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The election leaves in limbo a project that is part of Beijing's quest to increase its grip on the world's rare earths\u2014the raw materials necessary to make the batteries and magnets that power everything from cellphones and electric cars to wind turbines . Global demand for rare earths is forecast to soar, as countries push to meet their commitments under the Paris Climate Accord , which President Biden has decided to rejoin.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China mines over 70% of the world's rare earths and is responsible for 90% of the complex process to turn them into magnets, according to Adamas Intelligence, which provides research on minerals and metals. The mining project in Kvanefjeld, a mountainous area in Greenland known in Inuit as Kuannersuit, was expected to produce 10% of the world's rare earths, according to Greenland Minerals, an Australia-based firm that holds the project's exploratory license.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shenghe, one of the world's biggest producers of rare-earths materials, acquired a 12.5% stake in Greenland Minerals in 2016, making it the company's largest shareholder. Since then, Shenghe's stake has been diluted to 9%, but Greenland Minerals is relying on the Chinese firm to process any materials it extracts from Greenland, a technically challenging step that is key to the project's viability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concession includes uranium deposits, which locals fear could be released into the area's pristine natural landscape and farms. The project is also forecast to increase Greenland's carbon-dioxide emissions by 45%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miles Guy, Greenland Minerals' chief financial officer, said the firm had been on the verge of clearing the final hurdles in a yearslong regulatory marathon when the snap election was called. The firm has invested 130 million Australian dollars ($99 million) in the project.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In our view it would be an extreme display of bad faith to suddenly reverse all that,\" Mr. Guy said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit, said the election result gave her party a strong mandate to oppose the mine. \"It would be devastating for Greenland,\" Ms. Larsen said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At stake is Greenland's path toward independence. The island is still partly governed by Denmark, which helms the country's defense and foreign-affairs portfolio and gives Greenland an annual block grant of roughly 3.9 billion Danish krone ($623 million) to help fund basic services. Declaring complete independence from Denmark would require Greenland's mainly Inuit population of 56,000 to find another source of income to compensate for the loss of that grant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Guy said the Kvanefjeld project is expected to generate $200 million in annual tax revenue for Greenland's government as well as hundreds of local jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A decades-old defense treaty between Denmark and the U.S. gives the U.S. military virtually unlimited rights in the former Danish colony at Thule Air Base, the northernmost U.S. base, which houses part of a U.S. ballistic-missile early-warning system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in recent years, the U.S. has had to compete with China for influence on the North American island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2016, a Chinese government-owned company tried to buy an abandoned naval base in Greenland; Denmark sent four sailors to live there and shoo away Chinese interest. In 2017, a Chinese state-owned university announced it would build a polar research antenna on the island; Greenland's government said it hadn't approved the proposal, or even heard about it, and the project stalled.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That same year, Greenland's government flew to Beijing to meet with two Chinese state-owned banks to see if they would finance a new airport for the capital, Nuuk, whose tiny runway, carved into a snow-capped hillside, can receive only propeller planes. A larger airport, big enough to receive passenger jets, would help open up Greenland to tourism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But China's interest set off alarm in the Pentagon, which worried that if Greenland defaulted on the loans, the Chinese government could claim a strategic air strip just a few hours by flight from the U.S. eastern seaboard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2018, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis lobbied the Danish government to intervene, The Wall Street Journal reported. Denmark's government asked a consortium led by Danske Bank to help assemble an alternative financing package, which Greenland's government ultimately accepted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Journal reported In 2019 that President Donald Trump had privately asked advisers whether the U.S. could buy Greenland , expressing interest in its abundant resources and geopolitical importance. Months later, a delegation from the White House National Security Council, the State Department and the Pentagon visited the island, whose government had roundly condemned President Trump's offer to purchase their country. Last year, the U.S. opened a consulate in Nuuk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caught in the middle of the geopolitical maneuvering are the residents of fishing villages that dot Greenland's southern coastline. Narsaq, a town of about 1,300, feared the environmental damage that the project could unleash. Uranium mining is a deeply polarizing issue in Greenland, whose 1988 ban on extracting radioactive materials was lifted in 2014 by a single vote in parliament.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Debates within the ruling party forced Prime Minister Kim Kielsen to relinquish a party chairmanship post last year. \"This is, no doubt, the most controversial project in Greenland currently,\" said Martin Breum, lead correspondent for the Arctic Journal and a longtime writer on Greenland's internal politics. \"We are talking about one of the largest [rare earth] deposits outside China.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The election doesn't totally foreclose the possibility of rare-earth mining in Greenland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The IA party would be open to a referendum on the project, if any of its potential coalition partners insisted on one as a condition for joining the government, Ms. Larsen said: \"A referendum is something that could be done.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the party isn't opposed to the development of a second, more remote rare-earth deposit in the south of Greenland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It would be something that we definitely can look into,\" Ms. Larsen said. \"I think we would be much more open to the other project.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.com and Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China's Greenland Ambitions Run Into Local Politics, U.S. Influence</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Stacy Meichtry and Drew Hinshaw\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Mr. Trudeau has pledged to develop a framework for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions before a United Nations summit on Nov. 30.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plan comes at a challenging time for coal and oil producers in western Canada that are struggling to cope with low commodity prices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our goal is to become one of the world's most progressive and forward-looking energy producers,\" Ms. Notley said at a news conference in Edmonton. \"We are turning the page on the mistaken policies of the past.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The premier described President Barack Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline   earlier this month as a \"kick in the teeth\" and a wake up call for Canada to improve the province's environmental reputation. Mr. Obama cited Alberta's \"dirtier crude oil\"   in his decision not to approve the project, which is designed to carry oil-sands crude from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flanked by oil industry executives and representatives from Native American and environmental groups, Ms. Notley said the new levies would be \"revenue neutral\" to offset other taxes, and that some funds will be set aside to research energy technologies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Notley's left-leaning government swept into power   in May, ousting a right-of-center party that ruled the province for four decades and had played down the urgency of policies to address global climate change. Weeks later, Alberta said it would double its existing carbon tax   on large-scale industrial emitters to 30 Canadian dollars ($22.50) per metric ton by 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That tax will be extended across the province's economy by instituting levies on sales of gasoline and on household utility bills. Alberta also will end coal-fired generation of electricity and mandate that renewable forms of energy account for 30% of electrical production by 2030. Coal currently accounts for about 38% of Alberta's electrical generation capacity, with natural gas making up 44% of the total. The remainder comes from renewables such as hydroelectric generation, biomass and wind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government also said it would enact a limit on total oil-sands emissions of greenhouse gases of 100 million metric tons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alberta's oil sands are one of the most emissions-intensive forms of crude extraction. Oil-sands wells require steam injections to leach out crude embedded in sand, a process that burns up to 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas to produce a single barrel of oil. Canada's government estimates that oil sands-related emissions will nearly double to 103 million metric tons by 2020.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oil and gas producers in Alberta had expressed concerns about the rapid policy shift in recent weeks. But four of the biggest oil sands producers, including Suncor Energy Ltd., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and the Canadian unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, on Sunday said they backed the new initiative, noting it would accelerate clean- energy technology investment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This plan recognizes a need for a balance between the environment and the economy,\" Murray Edwards, chairman of Canadian Natural Resources, said at the news conference. \"We will do our part to address climate change while protecting jobs and industry competitiveness,\" he said, speaking on behalf of the province's top oil-sands producers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Production from the oil sands has been growing at a steady clip in recent years, making the industry one of the fastest-growing contributors to rising Canadian carbon emissions. Canada's environment ministry says the country's CO2 emissions have risen over the past five years and are expected to hit 781 million metric tons a year by 2020 if no reduction measures are taken.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Meaningful action in Alberta was long overdue,\" Alberta's environment minister, Shannon Philips, said at the news conference.

At the high end, blocking the project could be like taking 1 million cars off the road by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, this is not a final approval of the pipeline. Next up, there's a 45-day public comment period of the environmental review. Then the State Department will have to determine separately whether the pipeline is in America's national interest. Finally, President Obama has to decide whether to approve it or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, this is a key step in the process. Here are five key points from today's report:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1) Oil from Canada's tar sands produces 17 percent more greenhouse-gas emissions over its life-cycle than regular oil. As such, the State Department points out that the pipeline would increase overall greenhouse-gas emissions if it led to a significant expansion of Canada's tar sand production. And that, in turn, would worsen global warming. So that brings us to the key question</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2) The State Department thinks blocking the Keystone XL pipeline would put a modest dent in Canadian oil sands production. The logic here is simple enough. If Canada can't find an outlet for its oil, there will be less production. So what happens if Keystone XL gets blocked? A lot depends on whether other pipelines get built, such as a proposed project through British Columbia -- as well as how much oil can be shipped profitably by rail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department considers two scenarios. First, if the Keystone pipeline is denied, but other proposed pipelines go forward, tar sands production in Alberta \"could decrease by approximately 0.4 to 0.6 percent\" by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alternatively, if all future proposed pipeline capacity out of Western Canada was restricted, then tar sands production would drop by 2 to 4 percent by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a real drop, if a modest one. It means that if Keystone XL pipeline gets blocked, we would see a decrease of somewhere between 0.07 to 5.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030. At the high end, that would be like taking one million cars off the road.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's also not enough to tip the balance on climate: To put this in perspective, the United States emitted about 6,822 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide in 2010.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, environmentalists are already disputing this section of the review, arguing that blocking Keystone would deal a much bigger, crippling blow to the tar sands. \"Canadian tar sands exports are blocked to the west by tribes that won't sell out their natural resources to Big Oil, and blocked to the east by the European Union's declaration that it won't buy dirty tar sands oil,\" said Jim Lyon of the National Wildlife Federation. \"Without access to major U.S. export terminals from Keystone XL and other routes, tar sands production will be substantially slowed.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3) If the Keystone XL pipeline is blocked, rail transport could make up some of the difference. \"Rail and supporting non-pipeline modes should be capable, as was projected in 2011, of providing the capacity needed to transport all incremental Western Canadian and Bakken crude oil production to markets if there were no additional pipeline projects approved.\" Elsewhere, Robert Bryce has explained how rail companies will deliver oil if the pipeline gets blocked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4) A pipeline spill is \"very unlikely\" to affect the key Ogallala Aquifer. The Ogallala Aquifer in the Midwest is one of the key freshwater sources for the Great Plains. So there's plenty of justifiable worry about running an oil pipeline through this area, given the potential for leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the State Department's not overly concerned about this: \"Overall, it is very unlikely that the proposed pipeline area would affect water quality in the [Great Plains Area] due to weak downward gradients (downward groundwater flows) in the aquifers overlying the [Great Plains Area].\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5) The Keystone XL project, if built, would support 42,000 jobs over its two-year construction period. \"Including direct, indirect, and induced effects, the proposed Project would potentially support approximately 42,100 average annual jobs across the United States over a 1-to 2-year construction period (of which, approximately 3,900 would be directly employed in construction activities).\" As with all construction projects, these jobs would be temporary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related:Just how dirty are Canada's oil sands, anyway?\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

But experts question whether its commitment is sufficient, and whether it can persuade other nations to meet meaningful goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LONDON \u2014 As Britain prepares to host a landmark climate summit in Glasgow this week, the milestones of its own evolution to a more climate-friendly economy are on vivid display along the railroad line from London to Scotland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Near Gainsborough, a river town 150 miles north of the capital, one of Britain\u2019s last coal-fired power plants still spews carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Another 150 miles north, off the coast of the seaside port of Blyth, the slender blades of five turbines in an offshore wind farm turn lazily in the breeze.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two plants, both owned by the French utility giant EDF, illustrate how far Britain has come. The coal station, restarted recently to cover a shortfall in electricity, is slated to be taken out of operation next year, while the company plans to install experimental floating turbines in the waters off Blyth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a huge transition,\u201d said Paul Spence, the director of strategy and corporate affairs at EDF, referring to Britain\u2019s goal of being a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. \u201cA lot of things need to happen to keep the lights on.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Britain is not just the host of the climate meeting, known as COP26, it has a credible claim to being a global leader in climate policy. The birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, Britain became the first country to legally mandate reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions through the Climate Change Act in 2008. Its high-tech windmills and superannuated smokestacks are only the most visible evidence of a three-decade campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having built the world\u2019s largest offshore wind industry, Britain has reduced emissions by 44 percent from 1990 levels. Its target to cut them by at least 68 percent by 2030 is one of the most ambitious of any major economy, according to the Climate Action Tracker, a scientific analysis of the policies of countries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Britain achieves that target, which is far from clear, it would be one of a handful of countries doing enough to fulfill the key goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting the long-term rise in the planet\u2019s temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To hit its headline number, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government has set out a series of attention-grabbing goals: End the sale of all gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars by 2030; end the use of all coal and gas-fired power plants by 2035; and end the sale of all fossil-fueled home heating systems by 2035.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe U.K. was first out of the blocks with the climate act, and it inspired Sweden and then Germany,\u201d said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \u201cThe U.K. has successfully been able to phase out coal, which is very symbolic because it first started in England.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The temporary restart of the coal plant near Gainsborough \u2014 made necessary by low winds on the North Sea that slowed the turbines \u2014 shows that this transition is not without hiccups. A lack of wind or sun can stymie renewable energy sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Local resistance has constricted the development of the onshore wind industry. Fears about energy reserves have led Britain to consider allowing drilling in a vast new oil field off the Shetland Islands. There is even a proposal for a new coal field in Cumbria, in northwest England, which would seem to cut against Britain\u2019s climate aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate experts also fault Mr. Johnson for not laying out a realistic road map to achieve his ambitious emissions goals. Britain has failed to raise adequate funds to finance clean-energy projects. It has not shown farmers, key drivers in reducing emissions, how they can contribute by cultivating peat lands and other conservation techniques.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor is Britain the diplomatic dynamo it once was. When Mr. Johnson convenes more than 100 countries in Glasgow, he will push some vaulting goals, including a global end to the use of coal. But he will do so as the leader of a country that divorced itself from the European Union and has so far been unable to galvanize the world\u2019s biggest emitters: China, the United States and India.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, for all the fears of backsliding, Britons evince genuine pride about being pioneers in the transition to a carbon-neutral future. After all, said Alice Bell, a London-based climate change campaigner, \u201cWe led the world into this problem.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The country that was synonymous with the belching factories of the Industrial Revolution, that once darkened its skies and fouled its rivers, that gave the world the phrase \u201ccoals to Newcastle,\u201d now produces slightly more than half its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources, predominantly wind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While BP, Shell and other energy giants lobby the government to keep burning gas, there is no analogy in Britain to Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat with financial ties to the coal industry, who pressured the Biden administration to water down core elements of its climate legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike in the United States, where climate change is a partisan issue, green policies win broad support on the left and right. The Climate Change Act, which stipulated an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050, passed Parliament by a vote of 463 to 5.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nearly a dozen countries and the European Union now have similar laws on the books. In 2019, Mr. Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Prime Minister Theresa May, went even further, making Britain the first major economy to commit to being net-zero by 2050, meaning it would remove as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as it produces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some extent, Britain\u2019s leadership is an accident of history, rooted in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s bitter showdown with striking coal miners in 1984. By crushing the union and slashing subsidies for the coal industry, Mrs. Thatcher accelerated Britain\u2019s search for alternative energy sources, namely natural gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cShe got rid of the coal miners for a combination of political and economic reasons,\u201d said Tom Burke, the chairman of E3G, an environmental think tank, and a former government adviser. \u201cBut it gave the U.K. a degree of freedom of action that wasn\u2019t available to other countries.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Mrs. Thatcher later came to view climate activism as a left-wing preoccupation, she gave two speeches in 1989 that historians say were the first significant statements on climate change by a world leader.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat we are now doing to the world \u2014 by degrading the land surfaces, by polluting the waters and by adding greenhouse gases to the air at an unprecedented rate \u2014 all this is new in the experience of the earth,\u201d she said to the United Nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Thatcher planted the seed for a bipartisan cause, as Conservative and Labour governments sought to burnish their green credentials. British diplomats played key roles in brokering climate deals in Rio de Janeiro and Kyoto, Japan. Britain installed climate attach\u00e9s in its embassies around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2006, a British government adviser, Nicholas Stern, produced a seminal study of the economic effects of climate change, which framed the debate before the 2009 summit in Copenhagen and set the stage for the Climate Act, passed under a Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Conservatives came to power in 2010, they viewed climate policy as a way to appeal to younger voters, many of whom viewed the Tories as a tightfisted party in thrall to business interests. Parliament created a climate change committee, which prodded the government to adopt policies that would help Britain meet its goals. Several of its policies were mimicked by fellow European Union members. \u201cWe basically ran the E.U. on climate policy,\u201d Mr. Burke said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came the Brexit vote in 2016, and \u201cwe lost our most important tool for influencing other countries, which was the E.U,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Johnson, who once scoffed that wind farms would \u201cbarely pull the skin off a rice pudding,\u201d now speaks about climate change with the zeal of the converted. Allies say he has been convinced of the need for action by his third wife, Carrie Johnson, who campaigns against plastic pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But critics say Mr. Johnson\u2019s bracing words are belied by his actions. The Climate Action Tracker, while praising Britain\u2019s ambitions, criticized its financial commitment to achieving them, calling it \u201chighly insufficient.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s accurate to say that this is a betrayal of a national commitment by the current government,\u201d Mr. Burke said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Johnson\u2019s pro-Brexit government, he said, depends on support from the libertarian wing of the Tory party, which opposes far-reaching climate initiatives, while his anti-business messaging hinders partnerships with the private sector.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For private companies, the government\u2019s messaging has been muddled. EDF said it would like to build more onshore wind farms, but local resistance and lack of incentives has made it less attractive. And the government has struggled to line up financing for a new generation of nuclear plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe\u2019re only a quarter of the way toward the decarbonized energy system that the prime minister set as a goal for 2035,\u201d said Mr. Spence, of EDF. \u201cWe need all the answers, faster than we\u2019ve ever done them before, if we\u2019re going to get anywhere close to a 1.5-degree world.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of Britain\u2019s agenda-setting, there is also a sense among activists and experts that there is only so much a midsize country can do to solve a planetary problem. Its total emissions account for barely 1 percent of the world\u2019s total. China accounts for nearly 30 percent, and the United States for 14 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cImagine if these policies had been picked up in 1997 by the United States,\u201d said David King, a former climate envoy and scientific adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair. \u201cThe world would be a very different place.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

But today, even as the population crisis grows more severe, it has largely fallen off the agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Paul Ehrlich's seminal book on the subject, \"The Population Bomb,\" was published in 1968, when there were 3.5 billion people in the world and the population was growing by about 2% a year, with about 60 million more births than deaths annually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early this week, the United Nations Population Division published its population projections to the end of the century. The report announced that the rate of population growth has slowed to about 1%, but today there are more than twice as many people (7.7 billion) than when Ehrlich's book came out. That means that each year, 80 million more people are born than die -- the equivalent of adding a new Germany to the world every 12 months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report projects that world population will likely add an additional 2 billion people by 2050. Feeding 9.7 billion people won't be easy, especially given the abundant evidence that climate change will negatively affect the food supply, including in areas experiencing some of the greatest population pressure. The population of sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is expected to double by midcentury, and that of Niger will nearly triple. Already more than 40% of infants in Niger are stunted -- malnourished to the point where they will never reach their full human potential. Tens of millions of people will likely try to migrate from the region if drought worsens and crops fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or consider Pakistan and Nigeria, both countries that doubled in size between 1990 and 2019. These increases not only have brought rising levels of human suffering, they have geopolitical implications for all of us. A poor country cannot build schools and train teachers fast enough to keep pace with rapid population growth. In turn, it becomes impossible to create enough new job opportunities. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized that a large population of young men with poor education and few job opportunities is a recipe for \"social turbulence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.N.'s latest report estimates a global population of 10.9 billion by the end of the century, but its projections are not written in stone. The report also points out that if families the world over had, on average, one-half fewer children going forward, the population by century's end would have begun to decline, to about 7.3 billion. Conversely, if families have, on average, one-half child more, the population would reach 15.6 billion by the end of 2099. The huge difference that a half-child average makes could well determine whether our children and grandchildren live in a sustainable world, or one that is in danger of collapse as population pressure destroys the complex biosphere on which all life depends.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Bongaarts, a respected American demographer, has pointed out that only 1% of all overseas development aid is spent on family planning, although it is one of the most cost-effective forms of foreign aid. A drop in family size facilitates better education, reduces maternal and infant mortality, facilitates economic development and sets the stage for more democratic government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Family planning is an investment: It pays for itself by reducing the cost of education and health services in a poor country with rapid population growth. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the U.S. was the world leader supporting voluntary family planning. Many nations, including South Korea, Thailand, Colombia and Brazil, would be poorer and likely less stable without the support the U.S. gave to accelerate a decline in family size.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An important first step would be for the international community to move from investing 1% of foreign aid in family planning to investing 2% in it. Surveys show that hundreds of millions of women around the world would like either to have no more children or not to have more children in the next couple of years. Based on this fact, and our own experience working in many countries, we believe that increasing aid in international family planning could make that half-child difference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: THE POPULATION of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double by midcentury, according to the latest United Nations estimates, and the world will add another 2 billion people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Jeff Hutchens Getty Images</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Malcolm Potts and Alisha Graves are co-founders of OASIS (Organizing to Advance Solutions in the Sahel) at UC Berkeley.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

North Korea's nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clock, a metaphorical measure of humankind's proximity to global catastrophe, also advanced 30 seconds last year, to 2 1/2 minutes to \"midnight\" -- the closest to the apocalyptic hour it has been since 1953, after the United States tested its first thermonuclear device, followed months later by the Soviet Union's hydrogen bomb test.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before Thursday's announcement, experts said there was only one way the clock could possibly move given recent geopolitical events, including North Korea's ballistic missile test and the my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clock is symbolic, sitting at the intersection of art and science, and it has wavered between two and 17 minutes until doom since its inception in 1947.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A board of scientists and nuclear experts meets regularly to determine what time it is on the Doomsday Clock. This group, called the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, was founded by veterans of the Manhattan Project concerned about the consequences of their nuclear research. One of them, nuclear physicist Alexander Langsdorf, was married to artist Martyl Langsdorf, who created the clock and set it at seven minutes to midnight, or 11:53, for the cover of the group's magazine. Her husband moved the time four minutes ahead in 1949.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, the bulletin's board has determined when the clock's minute hand will move, usually to draw attention to worldwide crises that, the board believes, threaten the survival of the human species.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The group's reasoning has traditionally focused on the availability of nuclear weapons and a willingness among the world's great powers to use them. But in recent years, the scientists have also considered the threat posed by climate change, which they said in 2007 is \"nearly as dire\" as the dangers of nuclear weapons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In advancing the famed clock last year, the group noted that \"the global security landscape darkened as the international community failed to come effectively to grips with humanity's most pressing existential threats, nuclear weapons and climate change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the organization also cited the election of Trump -- \"who has promised to impede progress on both of those fronts,\" Krauss and retired Navy Rear Adm. David Titley wrote in an op-ed last year. \"Never before has the Bulletin decided to advance the clock largely because of the statements of a single person. But when that person is the new president of the United States, his words matter.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said a move toward \"midnight\" makes sense and that nuclear risks alone justified it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAPTION: Photo: Robert Rosner, chairman of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, moves the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock on Thursday to two minutes to \"midnight.\" CAROLYN KASTER/AP</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CREDIT: By Lindsey Bever, Sarah Kaplan and Abby Ohlheiser, The Washington Post\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Warned about additional environmental impacts such as light and noise pollution from the pipeline.</p><p>N/A|State Department official|U.S. State Department|N/A|Bureaucrat|Expressed intention to work with the Interior Department on environmental issues related to the pipeline.</p><p>Barack Obama|President|N/A|N/A|Politician|Commented on environmental considerations for the Keystone XL pipeline approval.</p><p>Shawn Howard|Spokesman|TransCanada|N/A|Industry/Corporation|Defended the company's environmental mitigation efforts for the Keystone XL pipeline.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Interior Department has warned that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline could have long-term, damaging effects on wildlife near its route, contradicting the State Department's March draft environmental assessment, which concluded the project would have only a temporary, indirect impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a 12-page letter sent as part of the public comment on the draft assessment, the Interior Department repeatedly labels as inaccurate its sister agency's conclusions that Keystone XL would have short-lived effects on wildlife and only during the project's construction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Given that the project includes not only constructing a pipeline but also related infrastructure, access roads, and power lines and substations, impacts to wildlife are not just related to project construction. Impacts to wildlife from this infrastructure will occur throughout the life of the project (i.e. operation and maintenance phases),\" the letter says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Extending 1,700 miles from Canada's oil sands to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, Keystone XL needs a presidential permit from the State Department because it crosses a U.S. border. The draft assessment focuses on the 875-mile section from the border in Montana through South Dakota to a pipeline hub in Nebraska.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The letter from the Interior Department grimly catalogs many ways Keystone XL could harm wildlife: \"species displacement, increased predation rates and predator travel lanes, increased nest parasitism, vehicle collisions with wildlife ... invasive plant species, increased wildfire risk, lower wildlife density, increase in collisions with power lines and electrocutions on power poles ... and increase in poaching.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Interior Department is the second major federal agency to criticize the State Department's draft environmental impact statement, a detailed look at the potential effects of the proposed pipeline on air, water, endangered species, communities and the economy. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency slammed the assessment, saying it failed to account for what could be considerable greenhouse gas emissions from the project and risks to aquifers along its route.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Interior Department declined to comment on the letter, referring inquiries to the State Department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The letter was sent April 29. But the State Department posted it to a website only last week, along with 100,000 other comments received at the same time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Interior on the issues described in its letter,\" a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss differences within the administration. \"The Department of State continues to review the presidential permit application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in a rigorous, transparent and efficient manner.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department could issue its final environmental impact statement at any time. The Obama administration must then determine whether the pipeline serves the national interest, based not just on the State Department's analysis, but those of other federal agencies too, such as the EPA and the Interior Department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In June, President Obama noted the pipeline's potential effect on climate change, saying, \"Our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TransCanada, the company that would own Keystone XL, said it was confident the State Department would still conclude the pipeline's effect on the environment would be minimal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As our application shows, there are detailed steps we have taken to mitigate impacts on the environment, sensitive areas, wildlife and communities,\" said TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard. \"There are already more than 12,000 pages of technical review that have been published on Keystone XL, and they have stated that there will be a minimal impact on environmental resources along the entire route.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most critics of Keystone XL have focused on the potential damage from an oil spill. The Interior Department letter warns of spills, but also highlights day-to-day negative environmental effects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The letter cautions that birds, such as the least tern and the piping plover, could be threatened in a protected area of the Missouri River in Nebraska, about 40 miles from where Keystone XL would cross the Niobrara River. Changes in water level could affect the birds' nesting activities, and they could be killed by flying into power lines and other new infrastructure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department analysis also says a fish called the pallid sturgeon would not be affected by \"temporary water withdrawals\" from rivers. But the Interior Department calls the statement unsupported.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Interior Department also raised concern about how the pipeline might damage wetlands and archaeological sites. And it warned that Keystone XL could create light and noise pollution that could affect people and wildlife alike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>neela.banerjee@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: ACTIVISTS PROTEST the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in Washington.

She has served as deputy treasury secretary and as a Federal Reserve governor; it is a natural step to Fed vice chair for supervision. But Raskin, unfortunately, also personifies a problem. She is an illustration of how polarization spreads: of how it reaches into supposedly technical bodies, threatening the role that experts play in government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raskin's prospects hit a bump because of her views on climate change. All 12 Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee boycotted a vote on her confirmation, blocking it from moving to the full Senate. Inevitably, the White House denounced the Republicans for \"playing politics with the American economy.\" The full story is more complicated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, Raskin wrote a column in the Financial Times that she probably regrets. Lamenting that the United States had been slow to tackle climate change, she proposed a way for the nation to \"leapfrog into global leadership.\" The trick, she argued, is to harness the potential of financial regulation. Because Congress is missing in action, the Fed and other banking overseers should fill the climate policy vacuum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, as Raskin urged, a respectable case for this position. Climate change is such a serious threat that any government agency with the power to effect change arguably has a responsibility to do so. Moreover, climate change presents financial risks. Banks may lend to companies that go bust because of fires or floods, or because green regulations eventually upend their business models. In the pursuit of financial stability, regulators can plausibly require lenders to hold sufficient capital reserves to absorb climate-related losses. As Raskin points out, central banks in Europe have incorporated such risks into their work. Their governments generally support this.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the United States isn't Europe. Because there is no political consensus on climate policy in Congress, Raskin's proposal to pursue climate policy by other means is seductive. But precisely because climate policy is so politically fraught, the Fed cannot wade into these waters without getting caught in the crosscurrents. Apolitical, effective public agencies are a national asset. But if their mandates stretch too much, they become political and ineffective.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The merits of Raskin's mandate-stretching proposal therefore come down to a risk-reward calculus. How big is the risk of politicizing the Fed? How big is the reward in terms of climate policy?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's start with the reward prospects. In theory, if the Fed ups the capital costs of lending to businesses with climate exposure, it will speed movement toward a green economy. In practice, this strategy is unlikely to work because money is fungible. If banks lend less to dirty companies, other kinds of financiers will fill the gap. The Economist reports that $60 billion of fossil-fuel-related assets have been snapped up by private equity firms in the past two years alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the climate gains from Raskin's policy are modest, the risks are larger than she acknowledges. The Senate action this week was something of a wake-up call. The 12 Republicans proceeded with their boycott even though it obstructed the confirmation of four other Fed leaders, including Jerome H. Powell, whose appointment to a second term as Fed chair has been welcomed by both parties. They went ahead, moreover, even though the timing could not have been worse. Inflation is at its highest level in four decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which gets to the chief worry about Raskin's climate position. Ever since Fed chairs Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan tamed inflation, the Fed's credibility has been riding high, and its independence could mostly be taken for granted. Even President Donald Trump thought better of his anti-Fed bluster once he found himself in office. Today, with inflation at 7.5 percent, Fed independence will be newly strained. As it raises interest rates, it is bound to be attacked \u2014 both for the resulting economic slowdown and for failing to hit the brakes earlier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With inflation back at the high levels of the past, Fed leaders need to recall the political challenges that beset their predecessors. Fed Chair William McChesney Martin was summoned to President Lyndon B. Johnson's ranch and shoved around the living room when he signaled a tightening of Fed policy. Martin's successor, Arthur F. Burns, became the target of a smear when he displeased President Richard M. Nixon. Later, Volcker confronted a president who openly wondered if the nation actually needed the Fed and a senator who threatened \"to knock out the Federal Reserve Board altogether.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Determined central bankers can resist these attacks by wrapping themselves in the mantle of apolitical stability. They stand for sound money and sound banks, and in the end few politicians can be against either of these propositions. But if central bankers are perceived to stray into politics, this defense will be undone. Raskin's proposed expansion of the Fed's mandate is well intentioned, to be sure. The timing, however, is terrible.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

In the United States, 70 percent of Americans say that climate change is real . Pope Francis has joined the call for action . Hundreds of thousands of people have come together for climate marches in Paris and New York, and demonstrators recently held fossil-fuel protests on six continents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That's what I call momentum,\" Daniel R. Tishman, the chairman of the board of the Natural Resources Defense Council , said in its recent annual report . \"This isn't just the wind at our backs; these are the winds of change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the movement that started with a straightforward mission -- to get more people to appreciate the dangers of climate change as a precursor to action -- is feeling growing pains. What may seem like a unified front has pronounced schisms, with conflicting opinions on many issues, including nuclear power and natural gas , that are complicating what it means to be an environmentalist in this day and age.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The factional boundaries are not hard and fast, with groups shifting their positions as the science and waves of activism evolve. The environmental movement has always been a congregation of many voices, and some disagreement should be expected on such complex and intractable problems as saving the planet. Still, the tensions remain strong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider some of the biggest points of contention:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are sharp disagreements over whether nuclear plants should be part of the energy mix to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Disasters like that at the Fukushima plant in Japan have undercut confidence in the technology, but it remains attractive to the Obama administration and many in the environmental movement, including James E. Hansen, a retired NASA climate scientist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters argue that nuclear plants can produce enormous amounts of power without the carbon dioxide that burning coal and natural gas produce. They also point out that the energy sources replacing existing plants tend to come from natural gas, causing greenhouse emissions. That was the case in New England when the Vermont Yankee plant was shut down , and in California after the closing of the plant at San Onofre .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California has decided to wind down the Diablo Canyon reactors by 2025, a lengthy transition that could allow a buildup of renewable energy sources to replace the lost power. The nuclear power debate extends to questions of whether to develop a new generation of plants that supporters say would be less expensive and safer, or whether to extend the lives of existing plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of nuclear energy argue that the move to renewable energy sources would not require a new generation of nuclear plants . Naomi Oreskes , a Harvard historian who has written about the tactics of those who spread doubt about climate change, said proponents of nuclear power had not proved that the risks of operating the plants, and the waste they produce, could be managed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We all agree that there is urgency to this matter,\" she said in an email interview. \"So do we really want to bet the planet (literally) on a technology with such a bad track record? And that even when it works takes decades to build?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She has called the pronuclear arguments from environmentalists \" a new, strange form of denial ,\" pointedly using a word associated with those who have disputed the validity of climate science itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Burning natural gas produces less carbon dioxide and smog-producing pollutants than burning coal, so environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and even President Obama once praised it as a \"bridge\" to renewable fuels: that natural gas plants could replace coal plants until alternate sources like solar and wind power could take over.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More recently, however, the environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is used to extract fossil fuels, and growing worries about the greenhouse gas methane, which often leaks when natural gas is produced and transported, have led many scientists and activists to call natural gas a \" bridge to nowhere .\" (The Sierra Club now has a \" Beyond Natural Gas \" campaign.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate campaigners like Bill McKibben have argued that the potency of methane as a greenhouse gas, especially in the short term, might make it worse than coal. He calls this \" the terrifying chemistry \" of warming, though others have disputed his interpretation of the science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. McKibben has described those who favor natural gas as a way to reduce greenhouse emissions as believers in \" painless environmentalism , the equivalent of losing weight by cutting your hair.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fight has made its way into the Democratic campaign for the presidency: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a national ban on fracking , while Hillary Clinton has suggested that the technology should be carefully regulated and that, if natural gas is a bridge to alternate energy sources, \" we want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible .\" Those putting together the Democratic Party platform narrowly rejected the call for a ban.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two distinct camps have emerged on the best strategy for dealing with companies like Exxon Mobil. One camp wants to attack their very existence, and to hurt their businesses and reputations as a way of accelerating the transition to renewable technologies like wind and solar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Universities and institutional shareholders like pensions and church endowments are being pressed to sell their stock in fossil-fuel companies, to fight projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and to disrupt construction of fossil-fuel facilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This approach animates the \"keep it in the ground\" campaign led by groups like Mr. McKibben's 350.org , which argues that many of today's fuel reserves are \"unburnable\" if climate change is to be slowed, and so must be considered \"stranded assets\" -- a notion that oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron reject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other side is the camp that wants to engage with the companies, particularly through shareholder proxies, to push for action on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Groups like the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment , as well as New York State and City officials, recently presented at Exxon Mobil's annual shareholder meeting proposals that would require the company to assess the business risks of meeting the Paris climate goals and to \"acknowledge the moral imperative\" to keep global temperatures from rising by more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial era; they also helped to pass a resolution giving shareholders greater say in corporate governance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shareholder action has improved corporate responsibility on many fronts, said Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican sister of Caldwell, N.J., who is the executive director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Companies know the work we have put on their desk is beneficial,\" she said in a recent interview, and cited the emergence of sustainability directors and efforts by many companies to reduce their emissions. \"I'm confident we have really initiated that over the decades,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More fundamentally, a split is growing between the large, traditional environmental groups that try to work with companies and the scrappy campaigners who stand proudly outside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Naomi Klein , an author on environmental and economic issues, has sharply criticized what she called \"a very deep denialism in the environmental movement among the big green groups,\" like the Environmental Defense Fund , which has worked with fossil-fuel companies to research methane leaks and to pursue market-based solutions to the climate crisis, like putting a price on carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Klein argues that capitalism inherently worsens climate change. Working within the system as the institutional players do, she has said, is \" more damaging than the right-wing denialism in terms of how much ground we've lost.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. McKibben said the kind of noisy activism that characterizes the work of organizations like 350.org helps correct what he sees as the institutional inertia of the established groups. He said the lack of mass-movement activism was a key reason behind the failure of legislation like the 2010 effort to develop a system to limit and put a price on greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we're going to win the climate fight, it will come with a change in the zeitgeist,\" he said. \"And that -- not particular pieces of legislation -- is the ultimate point of building movements.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fred Krupp , the president of the Environmental Defense Fund , disagreed. Working with industry, he said, had helped deepen the understanding of such issues as methane leakage, which could produce remedies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"More and more businesses want to be part of the solution,\" Mr. Krupp said. Collaborative efforts helped lead to last month's bipartisan passage of an overhaul of toxic substances legislation , he said, adding, \"And we're getting close to being able to do it with climate change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given these fault lines on various issues, a question naturally arises: Are they hurting the overall environmental movement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even on that question, there are disagreements.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Matthew Nisbet , an expert in environmental communications at Northeastern University, there is a risk that differences of opinion within the movement could lead to greater enmity over time, resulting in a lack of focus. Progress could be lost, he said, \"if they start to see each other as rivals and opponents, and they lose sight of broader climate goals and their true opponents.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many in the various factions of the movement say that there is more agreement than it may seem from afar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Krupp said that although tactics and technologies may differ, consensus has emerged on many points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have to keep most of the fossil fuels in the ground,\" he said. \"We all agree with that. The math dictates that. We all agree that the conversion to clean energy should be as quick as possible.\" Of natural gas, he said, \"it's an exit ramp , not a bridge.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The movement to combat climate change is building an even bigger tent as more nations, businesses, religious groups and even conservatives have committed to dealing with the threat of rising seas and changing weather.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The number of Republicans speaking out in favor of climate action is growing, with the emergence of climate-oriented conservative groups like R Street and the efforts of Jay Faison, a philanthropist who has pledged millions of dollars to support candidates willing to buck the party's orthodoxy on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ellen Dorsey, the executive director of the Wallace Global Fund , which has promoted the divestment of fossil-fuel holdings and investment in cleaner technologies, has called disagreements within the green camp \"noises around the margin.\" She predicted that a combination of high-level collaboration and street-level activism would hold governments to their Paris climate pledges and push back against recalcitrant business interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, Mr. Gore said in a recent telephone interview, economics may accomplish much of what governments have so far failed to do. Plunging costs of renewable energy make it more competitive than ever with fossil fuels. Similarly, the former vice president said, the biggest obstacle for nuclear power could be the expense of building new reactors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't have a theological opposition to nuclear power,\" he said. \"It's simply not cost competitive.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gore said that tensions among climate change activists follow the traditions of the civil rights movement, abolition, women's suffrage and gay and lesbian rights. \"In all such movements, there have been schisms, and minor splits as well,\" he added. \"It's just a natural feature of the human condition.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/science/climate-change-movement.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JOHN SCHWARTZ\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

The other argues that all such things are, in some sense, \"caused\" by climate change, because we have fundamentally altered the global climate and all the weather in it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While true, this \"all in\" philosophy doesn't adequately emphasize the fact that not all of the extreme weather we experience today has changed significantly. Some of it is just, well, the weather.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of our weather has  changed significantly, and now a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has outlined a rigorous, defensible, science-based system of extreme weather attribution to determine which events are tied to climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like the surgeon general's 1964 report connecting smoking to lung cancer, the report from the National Academies connects global warming to the increased risk and severity of certain classes of extreme weather, including some heat waves, floods and drought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is an important development. Climate change can no longer be viewed as a distant threat that may disrupt the lives of our grandchildren, but one that may be singled out as a factor, possibly a critical factor, in the storm that flooded your house last week. The science of extreme weather attribution brings climate change to our doorsteps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Understanding how climate change is affecting extreme weather is critical for insurers, policy makers, engineers and emergency managers as they assess risk and figure out how to make communities more resilient. This knowledge can help to steer decisions on where and how to build or rebuild after a storm or flood, or whether to build or rebuild at all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And those are decisions we're going to face with increasing frequency as the planet continues to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists are now able to assess, in some cases within days, whether and how much the risk of such an extreme weather event has changed compared to the past -- that is, before heat-trapping greenhouse gases altered our climate. This knowledge will help communities make decisions appropriate for today's risks. These can include storm surge risk maps that reflect sea-level rise, better water management to reduce the effects of longer and more intense droughts, and improved floodplain management in increasingly flood-prone areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change brings with it many existential threats -- rising seas, acidifying oceans, species extinction. But the most immediate and costly threats result from the changing risks of extreme weather. Our perception of these risks has been almost entirely based on the past. That's how insurance companies have assessed our premiums. But if weather risks change, and events that used to have a 1-in-500 chance of happening in any given year now have a 1-in-50 chance, insurance premiums will rise or insurance itself might become unavailable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's an example that underscores the predictive power of extreme event attribution: A recently published study in the journal Nature Climate Change analyzed record-breaking rains in Britain that flooded thousands of homes and businesses and caused more than $700 million in damage in the winter of 2013-14. Scientists found that such an event had become about 40 percent more likely. As a result, roughly 1,000 more properties are now at risk of flooding, with potential damage of about $40 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change is, of course, never the only player in a so-called natural  disaster. Many other natural and human factors are at play. Countless communities are vulnerable because of limited resources and poor infrastructure. Certain classes of extreme events will be relatively straightforward to dissect and attribute (heat waves, heavy rains, certain types of drought) while others are at the far edge of what science can now understand (tornadoes, wildfires and the frequency and intensity of hurricanes).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heat waves, for example, are expected to become more common, intense and longer because of the increase in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. One recent study found that an extreme heat wave last May in Australia was made 23 times more likely because of climate change. When the numbers get that big, it's fair to say that some episodes of extreme heat would have been virtually impossible  (but never absolutely impossible) without climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drought is more complicated because of the multiple factors -- temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, snowpack levels -- involved. The California drought is an example of this complexity. While we now know that higher temperatures resulting from global warming are worsening the drought, current evidence indicates that the lack of precipitation in the state is not primarily a result of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without the rigorous methodologies outlined in the National Academies report, we run the risk of attributing extreme weather to climate change based on sheer conjecture or political bias.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And sometimes it is easier to blame climate change than acknowledge inaction in the face of factors unrelated to the weather. For example, in a severe drought plaguing southeastern Brazil -- including S\u00e3o Paulo, with a surrounding metropolitan population of about 20 million -- some were quick to blame global warming. But in analyzing the underlying causes of this drought, my colleagues and I found, in a study published last year, that climate change was not a major influence. Instead, population growth, increasing water consumption and leaky pipes were the real culprits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Science is giving us an increasingly clear picture of how global warming is changing the weather. Still greater investment in research is needed to ensure that we're making the best possible decisions to protect our communities. We may not always like what we learn, but we can be certain that unless we take immediate action to slow climate change, its influence on our lives will only intensify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/opinion/what-weather-is-the-fault-of-climate-change.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: HEIDI CULLEN\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC report|Nonprofit/activist|The article cites the IPCC report's findings on the urgent need for action to limit climate change.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The awarding of a Nobel prize in economics this week to William Nordhaus \u2014 the first economist to develop a model of how the climate and the global economy are linked \u2014 highlights a tremendous lost opportunity to fight climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades ago, Nordhaus's work provided a set of tools that should have appealed to market-minded politicians as a way to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Yet American conservatives chose denial instead. And because the right ignored Nordhaus (and those who picked up on his work), it seems unlikely that this country will take the \"unprecedented\" actions that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said this week are necessary to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning in the 1970s, Nordhaus demonstrated how a growing economy increases greenhouse gas emissions, which warm the planet, and in turn cause economic damages in sectors as far flung as agricultural production and coastal property. Yet, he observed, the producers of those gases do not pay for the damages they cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1992, Nordhaus first published</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a model to estimate the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions. He used it to argue that a modest carbon tax would yield more in climate benefits than it would cost, estimating that an optimal carbon tax would start at $5 per ton of CO2 in the 1990, and rise over time: It would be near $10 per ton today. (Nordhaus's subsequent estimates of the proper carbon price have increased to $30 per ton in today's dollars, although the appropriate rate for a carbon price remains a matter of heated academic debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A carbon tax makes greenhouse gas emissions reflect the damages they impose, and nudges financial considerations toward lower-carbon resources. The great power of this mechanism is that it does not subject consumers and businesses to complex regulatory schemes drawn up on desks in Washington, D.C., but instead allows all sectors of the economy to find the lowest-cost paths to cutting emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That Nordhaus published this model 26 years ago underscores just how long global warming has been staring us in the face. 1992 was also the year that President George H.W. Bush signed the convention that created the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which recognized \"that States should enact effective environmental legislation,\" and that developed countries should \"take immediate action . . . as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels\".</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Republican administration had recognized the problem, and an economist with impeccable credentials had provided a solution that respected, and used, markets. Nor did the idea of taxing pollution to account for the damages it caused originate with Nordhaus. Leading conservative thinkers like Milton Friedman championed the concept as a superior alternative to regulations. Given this pedigree, it wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility for conservatives to have embraced such a tax as a viable approach to climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Republicans had embraced such an approach, and Democrats joined them \u2014 seeking common ground on a crucial issue \u2014 today we'd be living in a starkly different world than we are. In this alternate reality we would not see industry whipsawed while successive administrations enact ambitious regulatory programs (Democrats) and then roll them back (Republicans) \u2014 with the specter of their return hovering. Instead, the climate debate in Washington would be occurring within the traditional parameters of what the tax rate should be, and how we should be spending the revenue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our CO2 emissions would be lower, and coal-fired power, the power source with the highest CO2 emissions, would have been virtually eliminated. Although the fracking revolution that has made natural gas the fossil fuel of choice would still have occurred, its tenure as a \"bridge fuel\" between coal and renewables would be shorter. We would have far more renewable power, with fewer subsidies, because the tax would create an incentive to invest in non-carbon energy sources. We would also have avoided situations like the state-by-state scrambles to bail out nuclear plants for the sake of their zero-carbon electricity, as we've recently seen in Illinois and New York; instead, they would be enjoying the same competitive advantage as wind and solar power over gas- and coal-fired generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, economic growth would most likely have been unhindered. A carbon tax might have hampered short-term growth on the margins, but the drag would be lost in the wash of other macroeconomic trends and events. If used to cut other taxes, a carbon tax might have even helped create growth. With higher federal revenues, there would less federal debt, lower federal taxes, or possibly more spending on climate adaptation. Internationally, the United States would have a credible claim to climate leadership, which would also make other countries more inclined to listen to, and follow, the nation on other geopolitical issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, climate skepticism, one of the most significant and heavily politicized badges of political affiliation, might have been avoided. For decades, the repudiation of scientific expertise has been, with a few notable exceptions, all but a requirement for card-carrying Republicans. Who knows how many of the knock-on effects of this head-in-the-sand approach \u2014 from general anti-intellectualism to the specific \"fake news\" rallying cry \u2014 might have been prevented?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A far cleaner environment, markedly less political polarization, and an economy incentivized to be clean: That's what our world would look like had we acted on Nordhaus's ideas when he proposed them. That he was ignored by market-minded conservatives makes the awarding of the prize this week especially poignant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the IPCC report shows, we now need to take rapid, massive action to limit climate change. The things we've tried have helped on the margins, but it's time to get serious. Nordhaus still provides a good map for what we could do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By David Bookbinder;Joseph Majkut\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Still, critics said it wasn\u2019t ambitious enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed at climate talks in Glasgow to end deforestation by 2030, in a landmark agreement that encompasses some 85 percent of the world\u2019s forests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThese great teeming ecosystems \u2014 these cathedrals of nature \u2014 are the lungs of our planet,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said in describing the pact on Tuesday at an event attended by President Biden and the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pledge will demand \u201ctransformative further action,\u201d the declaration said, to preserve forests crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming. But while it was accompanied by several measures intended to help put it into effect, some advocacy groups criticized the agreement as lacking teeth, saying it would allow deforestation to continue and noting that similar efforts have failed in the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the heart of the plan is the effort to reduce the lucrative financial incentives to cut down forests. Much of the world\u2019s deforestation is driven by the world\u2019s demand for food, driving people to fell trees to make room for cattle, soy, cocoa and palm oil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement brings together countries including Brazil, where deforestation in the Amazon and elsewhere has spiked in recent years. But as often happens in diplomatic negotiations, securing widespread buy-in that entices the most critical countries to join comes with potential weaknesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt allows another decade of forest destruction, and isn\u2019t binding,\u201d said Carolina Pasquali, executive director of Greenpeace Brazil. \u201cMeanwhile, the Amazon is already on the brink and can\u2019t survive years more deforestation.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless the pledge underscores a growing awareness of the role of nature in tackling the climate crisis, something Britain has sought to highlight at the climate summit, known as COP26. Intact forests and peatlands are natural storehouses of carbon, keeping it sealed away from the atmosphere, where as carbon dioxide it speeds warming by trapping the sun's heat. But when these areas are logged, burned or drained, the ecosystems switch to releasing greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If tropical deforestation were a country, it would be the third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, according to the World Resources Institute. Only China and the United States emit more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twelve governments committed $12 billion, and private companies pledged $7 billion, to protect and restore forests in a variety of ways, including $1.7 billion for Indigenous peoples. More than 30 financial institutions also vowed to stop investing in companies responsible for deforestation. And a new set of guidelines offers a path toward eliminating deforestation from supply chains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Biden said he would work with Congress to deploy up to $9 billion to the global effort through 2030. \u201cPreserving forests and other ecosystems can and should play an important role in meeting our ambitious climate goals,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While that number fell short of a campaign trail promise of $20 billion for the Amazon, it represents a vast increase on past efforts from the United States. Any money related to climate change, though, would likely face opposition from Republicans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several policy experts called the suite of measures an important step forward, while emphasizing that far more is needed. \u201cThe financial announcements we\u2019ve heard in Glasgow are welcome but remain small compared to the enormous private and public flows \u2014 often in the sense of subsidies \u2014 that drive deforestation,\u201d said Frances Seymour of the World Resources Institute, a research group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Previous efforts to protect forests have struggled or failed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One program recognized in the Paris climate accord, the agreement among nations to work together in an effort to fight climate change, seeks to pay forested nations for reducing tree loss. But progress stalled. In 2014, an international pact known as the New York Declaration on Forests aimed to end deforestation by 2030, and a United Nations plan announced three years later, built on that pledge, yet deforestation continued.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of the new agreement point out that it expands the number of countries and comes with specific steps to save forests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is trying to change the economics on the ground to make forests worth more alive than dead,\u201d said Eron Bloomgarden, whose group, Emergent, helps match public and private investors with forested countries and provinces looking to receive payments for reducing deforestation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The participating governments promised \u201csupport for smallholders, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who depend on forests for their livelihoods and have a key role in their stewardship.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A growing body of research shows that nature is healthier on the more than quarter of the world\u2019s lands that Indigenous people manage or own. But they receive less than one percent of the climate funding aimed at reducing deforestation in tropical countries, according to Rainforest Foundation Norway.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tuntiak Katan, the general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities and a member of the Shuar people in Amazonian Ecuador, praised the support for Indigenous and local communities but questioned throwing money at a system he sees as broken. \u201cIf this financing doesn\u2019t work directly, and shoulder to shoulder, with Indigenous peoples, it\u2019s not going to have the necessary impact,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The value of healthy forests goes far beyond their ability to store away carbon. They filter water, cool the air and even make rain, supporting agriculture elsewhere. They are also fundamental to sustaining biodiversity, which is suffering its own crisis as extinction rates climb. This year, though, scientists found that parts of the Amazon have begun emitting more carbon than they absorb, as drier conditions and increased deforestation led to more fires and a degraded ecosystem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China is one of the biggest signatories to the deforest declaration, but the country\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, did not attend the climate negotiations in Glasgow. China suffered heavy forest losses as its population and industry grew over the past decades, though more recently, it has pledged to regrow forests and to expand sustainable tree farming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By China\u2019s estimate, forests now cover about 23 percent of its land mass, up from 17 percent in 1990, according to the World Bank. Though some research has questioned the scale and the quality of that expanded tree cover, the government has made expanded reforestation a pillar of its climate policies, and many areas of the country are notably greener than they were a couple of decades ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, China\u2019s participation in the new pledge may also test its dependence on timber imported from Russia, Southeast Asia and African countries, including large amounts of illegally felled trees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In tropical forest countries like Brazil and Indonesia, the deal will test a different kind of economic development. The United States and Europe grew wealthy in part by cutting down their forests generations ago. But now, with the world facing the climate crisis and biodiversity loss, they need to persuade developing countries to not follow in their footsteps \u2014 despite the powerful financial incentives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cCan we develop without deforestation first?\u201d asked Ana Toni, executive director of Brazil\u2019s Institute of Climate and Society, a climate advocacy group. \u201cThis is the big challenge. That\u2019s why we need to have an international effort.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

There were deadly monsoon rains in Bangladesh, the worst in more than a century, and then, in Pakistan, much worse: a third of the country submerged, more than a thousand dead and a million homes destroyed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for climate scientists, the most conspicuous weather event of the summer may have been the simultaneous heat and drought blanketing most of China. The country has been experiencing extreme heat for almost three months, affecting more than 900 million people. As many as 66 rivers in a single municipal area, around Chongqing, have \u201cdried up,\u201d according to the state broadcaster CCTV. As the weather historian Maximiliano Herrera put it memorably to New Scientist, \u201cthere is nothing in world climatic history which is even minimally comparable.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet for a weather event this exceptional, you could be forgiven for not knowing too much about it. China is the world\u2019s most populous country and by far its largest greenhouse gas emitter, and it may well be the most determinative force shaping the future of the planet. But for most Americans, it\u2019s as if climate change is happening there only behind a screen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In part, that is because while China is not exactly a closed country, it isn\u2019t exactly an open one either, which gives the reporting that does emerge the unreliable aura of eerie anecdote. There has been no reporting about what the extreme heat has meant for people living in the Xinjiang region, for instance, one of the two centers of the heat wave and home to camps where possibly more than a million Uyghurs and other non-Han natives of the area have been detained, many of them laboring under reportedly oppressive conditions \u2014 often in the country\u2019s dominant solar panel industry. The human toll of the heat wave is surely greater than we know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it isn\u2019t only lack of information that blinds us. An unprecedented climate episode in China is also hard for Americans to process because the country occupies such an unsettled role in the stories we tell ourselves, and try to tell the world, about warming \u2014 often moralistic ones, about good actors and bad, guilt and innocence. When extreme weather strikes China, the \u201cmeaning,\u201d beyond the obvious one, is more muddled. If we don\u2019t know what to make of China, the climate actor, we have a much harder time making sense of its climate suffering.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, China has served as a convenient rhetorical touchstone for the climate-minded on both left and right \u2014 often described as a bad actor and unreliable partner by climate and energy nationalists, and by agitated environmentalists as an example of what could be done, climatewise, given a political structure without so many troublesome veto points. These contradictory depictions have always depended much more on casual stereotype than genuine insight. But like any useful talking point, they are also built on something real. China is not just the world\u2019s largest climate polluter but is responsible now for about half of all global coal use and almost a third of all global carbon emissions \u2014 a growing share, and more than twice the American contribution. (Though on a per-capita basis, the United States is still doing much worse.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if China is doing much more damage now to the future of the climate than any other nation, it is also the case that the country has been the strongest force for clean energy over the past decade. Last year, China installed more renewable capacity than was rolled out in the United States, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa combined. And although the plunge in the price of renewables is often regarded as an authorless global market success story, probably the largest contribution to that price collapse has been investment and innovation in Chinese manufacturing (quite a lot of it under horrifying conditions in Xinjiang).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the story ended there, it would be confounding enough: China, as a global behemoth, simultaneously playing hero and villain. But China also seems to occupy a confusing place in the landscape of climate geopolitics because that landscape has shifted lately as well. Ten years ago, or even five, climate diplomacy often meant rhetorical appeals to global cooperation mixed with realpolitik efforts to move more slowly than your rivals. Today, decarbonization is still happening much too slowly, but fast enough to move the diplomatic dynamics away from a rivalry of inaction toward an apparent rivalry of action. Climate investment is booming in the United States, and with the CHIPS act and the I.R.A. climate bill now passed into law, the country has affirmatively joined what Politico recently called a new \u201cgreen-energy arms race.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power dynamics are shifting, too, not just in terms of trade deals, saber-rattling about Taiwan and China\u2019s recent cancellation of bilateral climate talks after Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. Since the global financial crisis, but especially since the election of Donald Trump and the bungling of the early American pandemic response, those indulging narratives of American decline often looked to China as a forbidding and inevitable successor: endowed with an overwhelming population, directed by a relatively frictionless model of booming state capitalism and unencumbered by the kinds of political dysfunction that seem unavoidable here. The country remains an obvious geopolitical rival, and just passed the United States in one measure of scientific contribution: publishing the world\u2019s most-cited journal papers. But recent events have complicated that uncomplicated picture of China\u2019s near future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, it turns out that the country isn\u2019t as big as we thought it was \u2014 and it is on track to get quite a bit smaller. The U.N. now projects that China\u2019s population may drop by as much as half by the end of the century, as it also ages steeply \u2014 a prediction more or less echoed by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, the \u201cChinese model\u201d is looking less enviable, economically, given the sudden collapse of the country\u2019s real estate and construction industries, a mass refusal to make mortgage payments across the country and such anemic growth figures that, alone in the developed world, the Chinese central banks are lowering their interest rates, amid significant inflation, out of even higher concern about the continuing recession. As recently as a year ago, it was widely predicted that China\u2019s economy would become the world\u2019s biggest as soon as the end of this decade; now some economists are wondering whether it ever will.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And third, the country\u2019s pandemic response, once the envy of the world, has become something more like a global joke, with citywide lockdowns still following from individual new cases and a national vaccination program that has not managed to reach even many of the most vulnerable elderly, with Chinese shots that the government doesn\u2019t seem to trust all that much to protect against death and severe disease.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This doesn\u2019t mean that a \u201cChina bubble\u201d is about to pop; that the country is anything other than the world\u2019s most consequential, for climate; or that the unsteady relationship between it and the United States is going to become any less important. But in early September, analysis by Carbon Brief showed that, thanks largely to pandemic shutdowns and a stuttering economy, Chinese emissions fell by almost 8 percent in the second quarter of 2022, compared with the previous year \u2014 a larger drop than the country experienced in the depths of pandemic lockdown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the midst of the pandemic, which temporarily lowered global emissions about 7 percent, climate watchers noted both that this was about the rate of decarbonization required to meet the most ambitious targets of the Paris agreement and that global shutdown was not a sustainable or appealing way to do it. But while China won\u2019t be following that path indefinitely, it is the path the country is on now \u2014 another reminder that the green transition will be both bumpier and more surprising than it looks on a graph from the I.P.C.C. And that no country\u2019s role in the morality play will stay fixed for long.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Things to Read</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fight continues over the permitting \u201cside deal\u201d Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia reached with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York as a condition of their Inflation Reduction Act compromise. The text of the deal hasn\u2019t yet been made public, but a striking number of House Democrats are already committed to voting against it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A team of Oxford researchers studying potential paths for energy transition find that \u201ceven without accounting for climate damages or climate policy co-benefits, transitioning to a net-zero energy system by 2050 is likely to be economically beneficial.\u201d How beneficial? Perhaps as much as $12 trillion in net savings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The flood damage in Pakistan continues to astound the world leaders helicoptering in, with estimates of total damages now up to $30 billion (more than 10 percent of Pakistani G.D.P.). Some are reporting that between 80 percent and 90 percent of the country\u2019s crops have been affected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Sachs comes out for climate reparations, in a column that includes this bleakly arresting data point: \u201cPakistan contributed roughly 5.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide between 1850 and 2020 \u2014 roughly what the U.S. emits each year.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Extreme heat knocked Twitter\u2019s Sacramento data center offline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A simple text message prompt to Californians led to a dramatic, immediate reduction in energy use, sparing the state major blackouts. It\u2019s a genuinely inspiring illustration that people are willing to do things if you ask them to, that relatively small measures can add up if you try to scale them and that oftentimes the most important thing is just a direct request.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers find microplastics in the water caught on plant leaves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A potential breakthrough in understanding the relationship between air pollution and cancer suggests that in the future, \u201cthe idea of taking a cancer-blocking pill if you live in a heavily polluted area is not completely fanciful.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A large-scale study from Britain of the risk of death for vaccinated and boosted Covid patients during the Omicron wave shows a familiar risk pattern: Age is by far the largest driver of risk, with an 80-year-old at more than 30 times the risk of death than a 50-year-old. (Most other comorbidities increase risk just threefold or so.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to one measure, the share of Americans living in poverty has fallen by half over just the past decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thank you for being a subscriber</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read past editions of the newsletter here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you\u2019re enjoying what you\u2019re reading, please consider recommending it to others.

Upstream along the Colorado River, in shrinking Lake Powell, another set of waterlogged human remains was recently found in a submerged car. Meanwhile, the bodies of long-dead mountain climbers are emerging from the melting glaciers of the Himalayas and the Alps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those macabre discoveries are the result of climate change, which doesn't care about the war in Ukraine or spiking gasoline prices or the coming midterm elections. Climate change marches on, and we ignore it in favor of our immediate interests at our grave near-term peril.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A mammoth wildfire in New Mexico has burned more than 370 square miles over the past few weeks and remains out of control. A deadly heat wave is scorching much of India and Pakistan, with daytime high temperatures of up to 120 degrees and lows in the 90s \u2014 and it isn't even summer yet. A new Chinese government report says that rapid sea-level rise poses an unprecedented threat to the teeming coastal cities of the world's most populous nation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I could go on. But we all know by now that climate change is ravaging the planet. We just keep finding reasons not to take the steps \u2014 or make the sacrifices \u2014 that we know are necessary to curb carbon emissions and prevent the worst-case scenarios from becoming our hellish reality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of those sacrifices involves paying more at the pump. The nationwide average price of a gallon of gasoline hit $4.42 on Thursday, an all-time high. Low-income Americans struggling to cope with inflation are suffering. The Biden administration and the Democratic Party, looking ahead to November, are worried. But we must keep in mind that paying higher gas prices now will mean better lives for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that follow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Russia's brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine leaves the United States and its allies no choice but to do whatever is possible to keep Russian fossil fuels, which fund President Vladimir Putin's war machine, off the world markets. We need to see this not as a problem but as an opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demand for petroleum products fell markedly during the two years of covid-19 shutdowns. With major economies ramping back up, demand has rebounded. But refining capacity fell for the first time in three decades in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency, which choked the supply of gasoline. And disruption of the supply from Russia \u2014 the United States, for example, has imposed a total ban on imports of Russian oil \u2014 sent rising gas prices even higher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sky-high price of gasoline is a powerful incentive to use less of it \u2014 which would mean reduced carbon emissions. But it is also a powerful incentive for motorists to get angry at the politicians who lead their governments. President Biden has responded with an unprecedented release of oil from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve, a move echoed by allied governments around the world. \"We all over-rely on fossil fuels,\" Cecilia Rouse, chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, told me on Thursday. \"That's just the reality of today.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has not, however, given in to the \"drill, baby, drill\" hectoring of Republican critics, who see the solution to high gas prices as bringing more and more U.S. oil out of the ground \u2014 and, eventually, spewing its heat-trapping carbon into the atmosphere. On Wednesday, the administration canceled the planned sale of offshore oil and gas leases, including 1 million acres off the Alaska coast and more in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The right long-term solution, for the sake of the planet, is not increasing the supply of fossil fuels. It's reducing the demand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One impact of high gasoline prices should be to spur greater demand for electric vehicles, which have a much smaller carbon footprint. They allow drivers to blissfully ignore prices at the pump \u2014 and, with their terrific acceleration, to embarrass Ferrari owners at stoplights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The price spike comes as mass-market electric vehicles come on the market in earnest. Ford is about to ship its F-150 Lightning, the all-electric version of the pickup truck that has been America's most popular vehicle for a generation. The base model will cost around $40,000 \u2014 not cheap, exactly, but within the range of what a buyer would expect to pay for a brand-new pickup with a few bells and whistles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rivian already has its electric pickup on the streets. Other carmakers, including General Motors, are following suit as fast as they can. Imagine the difference it would make if all the pickups on U.S. streets stopped belching carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These high gas prices, and shallow lakes, are telling us to make good choices. We should listen.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

Sixteen other states also saw a top-five warmest summer on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which issued its findings Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nationwide, the stretch from June to August tied with the 1936 Dust Bowl summer as the hottest on record, with temperatures across the country averaging 2.6 degrees above average.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures have been a common denominator in a summer of ecological crises across the West.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A heat wave that blanketed the Pacific Northwest in June claimed the lives of hundreds, including immigrant farmworkers and the elderly. An estimated 1 billion sea creatures died because of heat off the coast, and the Sacramento River is facing a \"near-complete loss\" of young Chinook salmon because of abnormally warm waters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The searing heat dried the state's landscape and helped pave the way for more than 2 million acres to burn, with officials fearing the worst is yet to come. The blazes sent scores of residents fleeing from their homes and choked countless others with lung-burning smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just this week, Lancaster saw its 58th day of the year with temperatures above 100 degrees -- breaking a record from 2003. Fresno broke its record with 64 triple-digit days. On Wednesday, record temperatures for Sept. 8 were registered in Palmdale, Sandberg and Paso Robles, where highs reached 106, 95 and 106 degrees, respectively, the National Weather Service said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"All these records are being broken, and broken in quick succession,\" said Karen McKinnon, an assistant professor at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, \"and that's basically indicative of this trend that is largely due to climate change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grim conditions of the Dust Bowl years were more of an outlier, McKinnon said, while the latest extremes belong to a larger warming trend. In fact, she said, the summer of 2021 was even hotter than mere extrapolation would suggest, leading some to question whether that warming is accelerating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alan Barreca, an environmental economist at UCLA, said the record summer months were not surprising given the \"fairly steady increase in temperatures in California and throughout the world\" -- but they are concerning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Extreme heat is among the deadliest of natural disasters, he said, and soaring temperatures often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, including pregnant women, infants, elderly people, homeless people and residents of low-income neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Extreme heat is also worrisome because it expands the necessity for and reliance on air conditioning -- which not only furthers inequality but also feeds into the climate-change system that is driving temperatures up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Air conditioners seem to be an absolute necessity going into the end of the 21st century,\" Barreca said. \"We're going to need them, and we're going to also need to be cutting back on our emissions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conditions have already become so dire that the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid, on Tuesday asked the federal government to declare an \"electric reliability emergency\" that would allow six natural gas-fired power plants -- including facilities in Huntington Beach and Long Beach -- to generate power at maximum levels, even if they violate air pollution limits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a scrambling effort by state officials to reduce the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased energy demands by adding new electricity supplies, including fossil-fuel resources that contribute to climate change and worsening heat waves -- a short-term sacrifice that has proved controversial among clean energy groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grid operator was granted a similar request during a heat wave last September, but only for a week. This time, the agency is asking for 60 days -- a sign that it expects extreme heat could continue well into the fall. The ISO has already issued two flex alerts this week, which call on residents to conserve energy from 4 to 9 p.m., when net demand is typically at its peak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even as the energy grid groans, heat advisories and storm-system warnings are promising to bring more dangers to residents in the form of increased fire weather. More than a dozen active wildfires are burning across California, and officials fear that added heat, dryness and the potential for dry lightning could make conflagrations worse or even ignite new ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Weather Service is forecasting very hot and dry conditions in Southern California through Friday, with temperatures in some areas expected to be 5 to 15 degrees warmer than normal. The Antelope Valley area could see daytime temperatures as high as 108 degrees, while Los Angeles will climb into the 90s Friday and Saturday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A heat advisory also has been issued across the Inland Empire, the Santa Ana Mountains and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties through Friday. Residents are advised to seek shade, stay hydrated and avoid any activity that could spark a fire.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In several areas across the state, the possibility of thunderstorms could bring erratic winds, flash flooding and the \"potential for lightning-caused wildfires,\" officials said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's all a concern,\" said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the weather service in Oxnard. \"If a lightning strike starts a fire, then the gusty winds could push it quickly. And aside from thunderstorm activities, it's going to be pretty warm and dry. ... So with the heat, with any gusty winds -- elevated fire danger.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the maximum threat remains in Northern California, where beleaguered fire crews are still battling the 927,000-acre, multicounty Dixie fire and the 217,000-acre Caldor fire burning near South Lake Tahoe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're right smack in the middle of wildfire peak season,\" Chief Thom Porter of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said this week. \"Everybody needs to remain vigilant.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Weather Service said much of the fire zone, including Plumas and Lassen counties and the South Lake Tahoe area, will be hit with gusty winds and the chance of thunderstorms Friday, although a cooling trend should bring temperatures down in the days to come.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dry lightning strikes -- which last year spurred a rash of wildfires in the fall -- are a possibility. A fire weather watch has been issued across much of Northern California through 11 p.m. Friday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the fires have forced thousands to flee their homes, they have driven many others to stay indoors with their windows shut against the toxic smoke. Barreca, of UCLA, said that could be a deadly pattern for people without air conditioning during a heat wave.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And McKinnon noted that the extreme weather behaviors plaguing the state -- including fire, heat and drought -- are all connected. The stagnant high-pressure system that created many of the summer's \"heat domes\" are also associated with low precipitation and heating of the state's surface.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The warming of temperatures overall can lead to drying, and that drying later in the season can lead to warming, and all of those things can lead to enhanced wildfire,\" she said. \"Basically, it's all linked.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Times staff writer Sammy Roth contributed to this report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: A FIREFIGHTER battles the Dixie fire near Janesville, Calif., last month.

She is autistic, diminutive, not given to long speeches. But her decision to regularly skip school to sit in front of the Swedish Parliament since August to demand action on the climate has helped inspire a global movement of young people who share her alarm and anger. Tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and many other countries have followed her lead. A global school boycott to raise climate consciousness is scheduled for Friday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the United States, young environmental activists of the Sunrise Movement created a major stir when more than 150 staged a sit-in at Representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office a week after the midterm elections. And a video of a youthful delegation delivering a letter to Dianne Feinstein, the veteran Democratic senator from California, in which she tries to school them on the realities of politics while they talk of a dying earth, went viral in February.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The American students have found a strong ally in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old Democratic congresswoman from New York who last month introduced a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d resolution in the House. The document sets out not only a remarkably ambitious program for a rapid transfer to renewable energy, but also a broad set of ideas on how society should be fundamentally rebuilt. Not surprisingly, the Green New Deal was gleefully pounced on by Republicans as a \u201cTrojan horse for socialism\u201d and stands no chance of adoption, but it has become something of a litmus test for where Democrats stand on climate change \u2014 and something of a manifesto for the rising generation of activists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parliamentary maneuvers is not their game.

The administration is attempting to show progress in fighting climate change before Mr. Biden heads to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Science Based Targets initiative</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Larger efforts are stalled in Congress. Among other disagreements, Democrats there continue to haggle over whether to include a carbon tax in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many economists and business executives say a carbon tax would be more effective than financial regulation at engineering a shift away from fossil fuels. But Mr. Biden and other Democrats have adopted priorities from environmentalists who have said the government should push Wall Street firms to take action on climate change and more directly account for it in their operations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents, including many Republicans, say that fighting climate change falls largely outside the scope of financial regulation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>White House officials say their efforts face a lengthy road ahead. However, they are also making the case that consumers need to be protected from wildfires, floods and other events linked to extreme weather that could threaten U.S. assets and investments, including $12 trillion in private retirement savings and pension accounts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This road map isn't about protecting our financial system. It's about protecting people, their paychecks and their prosperity,\" Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, said in a call with reporters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report comes as part of a White House effort to review climate risks both inside and outside government. In May, Mr. Biden told administration leaders to assess what financial risks climate change posed to federal programs and the stability of the U.S. government and what new steps they might need to take to protect the financial system and its consumers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Major U.S. law firms said the process is laying a foundation for climate change-related regulations that the administration would apply to banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday's report outlines and explains many of the efforts that are already under way. Those include the consideration of new rules to expand access to insurance and of standards for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other agencies for factoring climate risks into loans they underwrite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Financial regulators including the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies have already joined the administration's broader push to fight climate change. Earlier this year, the Treasury Department appointed a senior official to a newly created post to coordinate the efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Both the impact of climate change itself and policies to address it could have major impacts, creating stranded assets, generating large changes in asset prices, credit risks and so forth that could affect the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at her confirmation hearing in January. She has repeatedly described climate change as an \"existential threat.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard said last week that financial regulators should direct the nation's biggest banks to take new steps to manage climate-related risks as part of a broader effort to monitor potential hazards posed to the financial system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Brainard said the Fed is examining ways to incorporate so-called scenario analysis to account for both the physical risks of climate change and the costs associated with any transition to a lower-carbon-footprint economy. Natural disasters and government policy actions to address climate change \"could quickly alter perceptions of future risk or reveal new information about the value of assets,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, is working on rules to require more disclosures from public companies about their greenhouse-gas emissions as well as risks that their earnings and operations face from climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said in July that the agency is considering whether climate-related disclosures should be filed in companies' annual reports, known as Form 10-K, along with financial data and other information considered crucial to investors. Such rules would require companies to provide statements that are both complete and accurate, making it easier for SEC enforcement attorneys to investigate firms or their directors for fraud or disclosure failures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SEC has already sent letters to dozens of public companies asking them to provide more information to investors about how climate change might affect their financial earnings or business operations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, formed an internal unit earlier this year to gauge the dangers posed by climate change to futures and options markets. The unit's aim is to ensure that derivatives products and markets fairly take into account climate-change risks, including factors such as severe weather, in their pricing and other activities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com and Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden Presses Climate Agenda on Wall Street</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Timothy Puko and Paul Kiernan\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}
{"id": "txt/2476261350.xml.txt", "text": "<div id='source_options'><p>N/A|N/A|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|N/A|Government|NOAA provided information on the number of billion-dollar disasters in 2020.</p><p>N/A|N/A|Copernicus Climate Change Service|N/A|Nonprofit/Activist|Reported that 2020 tied with 2016 for the hottest year on record globally.</p><p>Steve Bowen|Head of Catastrophe Insight|Aon Insurance|N/A|Industry/Corporation|Discussed the impact of climate change on weather events and the increase in losses.</p><p>N/A|N/A|Munich Re|N/A|Industry/Corporation|Provided data on financial losses in the US due to hurricane-related events.</p><p>Andrew Freedman|N/A|N/A|N/A|Media/Author|Contributed to the report, possibly by providing research, writing, or analysis.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The year 2020 will go down in the history books as one riddled with a record number of billion-dollar disasters. According to a new report released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on Friday, losses in the United States alone tallied a staggering $95 billion from 22 separate billion-dollar events. The previous record for billion-dollar disasters was 16 in 2011 and in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The year marked the most severe wildfire season across the West to date, with California logging five of its six biggest wildfires in state history. It was also the Atlantic's busiest hurricane season on record, with 12 landfalling named storms in the United States, while swarms of tornadoes ravaged the South.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most expensive disasters stemmed from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Hurricanes and tropical storms were close contenders, plaguing the Gulf Coast with relentless back-to-back strikes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disasters stand against the backdrop of a warming climate, with annual average temperatures in the Lower 48 states running 2.4 degrees above the 20th-century baseline. Globally, 2020 tied 2016 for the hottest year on record, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change is tied to larger, more extreme fires, hurricanes that intensify more rapidly and other trends that lie behind an increase in disaster damages. Another factor is population growth, with more people and buildings in harm's way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Weather events have always and will always occur,\" Steve Bowen, head of catastrophe insight at Aon Insurance, wrote in an email. \"But with climate change expected to increasingly affect the behavior of weather events, and if you tie that with more 'stuff' in harm's way, then the expectation is that resultant loss totals will also increase in the future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the number of individual billion-dollar disasters topped the charts, 2020 still lags behind 2005, 2012 and 2017 for overall costs. 2005 hosted a record hurricane season that included storms Rita, Wilma and Katrina, while storms such as Harvey, Irma and Maria raged in 2017. Hurricane Sandy slammed New Jersey and New York City in 2012.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thunderstorms were the costliest hazard of 2020</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirteen of 2020\u2032s billion-dollar weather disasters resulted from outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, including several very costly hailstorms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nashville was hit by one of the year's most devastating storms. Residents went to sleep the night of March 2 with the forecast calling for isolated strong thunderstorms and a very low tornado risk. Instead, a vicious EF3 twister plowed through the city after midnight, while an even stronger EF4 ravaged Cookeville, 80 miles to the east. Twenty-five people died in the largely unpredicted storms, which caused $2.5 billion in damage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>April was jam-packed with costly severe weather, including at least three major tornado outbreaks during the historic month. With 351 tornadoes, the month was the second-most active April for tornadoes on record, behind only the famous outbreaks of April 25-28, 2011. The most substantial outbreak occurred on Easter Sunday, April 12. At least 140 tornadoes touched down during the twister swarm, which cost $3.6 billion and was blamed for 35 deaths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The year also brought the most expensive single thunderstorm in U.S. history \u2014 the Corn Belt derecho of Aug. 10.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A nondescript batch of severe thunderstorms blew up into a top-tier windstorm as it roared across Iowa during the early afternoon, lashing some communities like Cedar Rapids with winds of 120 to 140 mph. Unlike a tornado, this damage wasn't localized \u2014 destructive to extreme winds plowed a path 770 miles long in 14 hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of the damage was agricultural; 10 million acres, or 43 percent of Iowa's corn crop, was affected. Eleven billion dollars in damage resulted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A pricey hurricane season</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A week before the derecho raked Iowa, hurricane season kicked into full force along the Gulf and East coasts. First up was Isaias in early August, a low-end Category 1 hurricane that rode up the Eastern Seaboard as a tropical storm. Damaging winds from the Carolinas to Maine cut power to millions, while the storm generated 34 tornadoes in the Mid-Atlantic and flooding rains. It caused 16 deaths and nearly $5 billion in damage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that was just the beginning. August concluded with the most powerful hurricane to hit Louisiana in 150 years when Category 4 Hurricane Laura slammed Lake Charles with 150 mph winds. An \"unsurvivable\" storm surge narrowly missed the city. The storm incurred at least $19 billion in damage and claimed 42 lives. On Oct. 10, Category 2 Hurricane Delta hit virtually the exact same area, causing an additional $2.9 billion in damage and yanking off hundreds of tarps serving as temporary roofs after the passage of Laura.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hurricane season was punctuated by other billion-dollar storms, too \u2014 Category 1 Hanna caused just over $1 billion in damage at the end of July, with other storms such as Sally, which hit Alabama, and Zeta, which breezed through New Orleans and across the South, causing damage as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Munich Re, an insurance company, hurricane-related losses in the United States this year came to $43 billion. That's about a fifth of the total loss from all natural disasters worldwide during 2020. Six of the world's 10 priciest disasters of 2020 hit the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drought and fire</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the West, storms weren't the problem. In fact, it was the opposite \u2014 prolonged drought, extreme heat and widespread, strong offshore wind events, linked in large part to human-caused climate change, contributed to a record wildfire season.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than 10 million acres burned across the West, including California's largest fire on record \u2014 the August Complex. It started as 37 individual blazes that merged into a massive fire that torched more than 1 million acres, becoming the state's first \"gigafire.\" Some 10,500 structures were damaged or destroyed in California alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Multiple wildfires exhibited extreme behavior, yielding smoke plumes towering to 50,000 feet and producing lightning and fire tornadoes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Oregon, historic wildfires burned more than 2,000 buildings, while Colorado experienced an extreme fire season as well. The Centennial State's three largest wildfires on record all took place during 2020. On the whole, wildfires caused $16.5 billion in destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fires were fueled by persistent hot and dry weather, with California experiencing a long, hot spring, summer and fall, with its warmest August and September on record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies have shown that climate change is causing more extreme fire weather days, which feature exceptional heat and dryness, along with strong and often erratic winds. Global warming has already led to a large increase in the occurrence of huge wildfires in the West, indicating that the massive blazes this year, which fouled the air across a broad region, were no fluke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In early September, Los Angeles set a record high of 122 degrees, while temperature records fell up and down the Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That same record heat contributed to a worsening drought that engulfed the West, causing $4.5 billion in mainly agricultural losses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The record number of billion-dollar events caused 262 deaths during 2020. Bowen says action is needed to address the increased movement of people into at-risk areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"While there is heavy focus on the frequency and intensity of events, we need to be equally highlighting that people are moving at an accelerated rate into some of the most vulnerable areas for extreme weather,\" wrote Bowen. \"It is imperative that we improve awareness around people better preparing their home or business in the face of inevitable [hazards].\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That, Bowen says, starts with knowing one's own vulnerability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need to ensure that people understand the natural peril risk at their location.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew Freedman contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

The imbalance was forcing officials to order rolling blackouts across the state for the first time in nearly two decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was unusual about the emails was whom they were sent to: people who managed thousands of batteries installed at utilities, businesses, government facilities and even homes. California officials were seeking the energy stored in those machines to help bail out a poorly managed grid and reduce the need for blackouts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many energy experts have predicted that batteries could turn homes and businesses into mini-power plants that are able to play a critical role in the electricity system. They could soak up excess power from solar panels and wind turbines and provide electricity in the evenings when the sun went down or after wildfires and hurricanes, which have grown more devastating because of climate change. Over the next decade, the argument went, large rows of batteries owned by utilities could start replacing power plants fueled by natural gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that day appears to be closer than earlier thought, at least in California, which leads the country in energy storage. During the state\u2019s recent electricity crisis, more than 30,000 batteries supplied as much power as a midsize natural gas plant. And experts say the machines, which range in size from large wall-mounted televisions to shipping containers, will become even more important because utilities, businesses and homeowners are investing billions of dollars in such devices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cPeople are starting to realize energy storage isn\u2019t just a project or two here or there, it\u2019s a whole new approach to managing power,\u201d said John Zahurancik, chief operating officer at Fluence, which makes large energy storage systems bought by utilities and large businesses. That\u2019s a big difference from a few years ago, he said, when electricity storage was seen as a holy grail \u2014 \u201cperfect, but unattainable.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Aug. 14, the first day California ordered rolling blackouts, Stem, an energy company based in the San Francisco Bay Area, delivered 50 megawatts \u2014 enough to power 20,000 homes \u2014 from batteries it had installed at businesses, local governments and other customers. Some of those devices were at the Orange County Sanitation District, which installed the batteries to reduce emissions by making it less reliant on natural gas when energy use peaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Carrington, Stem\u2019s chief executive, said his company would have provided even more electricity to the grid had it not been for state regulations that, among other things, prevent businesses from selling power from their batteries directly to other companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe could have done two or three times more,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The California Independent System Operator, which manages about 80 percent of the state\u2019s grid, has blamed the rolling blackouts on a confluence of unfortunate events: A gas plant abruptly went offline, a lack of wind stilled thousands of turbines, and power plants in other states couldn\u2019t export enough electricity. (On Thursday, the grid manager urged Californians to reduce electricity use over Labor Day weekend because temperatures are expected to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in recent weeks it has become clear that California\u2019s grid managers also made mistakes last month that were reminiscent of an energy crisis in 2000 and 2001 when millions of homes went dark and wholesale electricity prices soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grid managers did not contact Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office until moments before it ordered a blackout on Aug. 14. Had it acted sooner, the governor could have called on homeowners and businesses to reduce electricity use, something he did two days later. He could have also called on the State Department of Water Resources to provide electricity from its hydroelectric plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Weather forecasters had warned about the heat wave for days. The agency could have developed a plan to harness the electricity in numerous batteries across the state that largely sat idle while grid managers and large utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric scrounged around for more electricity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That search culminated in frantic last-minute pleas from the California Public Utilities Commission to the California Solar and Storage Association. The commission asked the group to get its members to discharge batteries they managed for customers like the sanitation department into the grid. (Businesses and homeowners typically buy batteries with solar panels from companies like Stem and Sunrun, which manage the systems for their customers.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey were texting and emailing and calling us: \u2018We need all of your battery customers giving us power,\u2019\u201d said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the solar and storage association. \u201cIt was in a very last-minute, herky-jerky way.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the time of blackouts on Aug. 14, battery power to the electric grid climbed to a peak of about 147 megawatts, according to data from California I.S.O. After officials asked for more power the next day, that supply shot up to as much as 310 megawatts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had grid managers and regulators done a better job coordinating with battery managers, the devices could have supplied as much as 530 megawatts, Ms. Del Chiaro said. That supply would have exceeded the amount of electricity the grid lost when the natural gas plant, which grid managers have refused to identify, went offline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Officials at California I.S.O. and the public utilities commission said they were working to determine the \u201croot causes\u201d of the crisis after the governor requested an investigation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grid managers and state officials have previously endorsed the use of batteries. The utilities commission last week approved a proposal by Southern California Edison, which serves five million customers, to add 770 megawatts of energy storage in the second half of 2021, more than doubling its battery capacity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Zahurancik\u2019s company, Fluence, is building a 400 megawatt-hour battery system at the site of an older natural gas power plant at the Alamitos Energy Center in Long Beach. Regulators this week also approved a plan to extend the life of the power plant, which was scheduled to close at the end of the year, to support the grid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But regulations have been slow to catch up with the rapidly developing battery technology.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regulators and utilities have not answered many of the legal and logistical questions that have limited how batteries owned by homeowners and businesses are used. How should battery owners be compensated for the electricity they provide to the grid? Can grid managers or utilities force batteries to discharge even if homeowners or businesses want to keep them charged up for their own use during blackouts?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the recent blackouts, Ms. Del Chiaro said, commercial and industrial battery owners like Stem\u2019s customers were compensated at the rates similar to those that are paid to businesses to not use power during periods of high electricity demand. But residential customers were not paid and acted \u201caltruistically,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, many energy companies and some conservative lawmakers are skeptical about batteries. They argue that it would be far better to build and maintain natural gas power plants because utilities have decades of experience with them and gas is abundant and relatively cheap. Batteries, they argue, are expensive and can provide electricity only for short stretches \u2014 typically four or five hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dominion Energy, one of the nation\u2019s largest utilities, for example, is investing in batteries but has also argued that natural gas power plants are critical to ensuring a reliable grid. \u201cOur view is that it cannot be an either-or decision,\u201d Katharine Bond, a Dominion vice president, said in a recent interview.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But both proponents and critics of batteries agree that such devices, along with renewable energy, pose a fundamental challenge to an electricity system that has long worked in a top-down way. Historically, utilities built power plants and strung lines to deliver electricity to homes and businesses. That model was stable for decades, and it earned utilities a guaranteed rate of return on their investments, typically 10.5 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But homes and businesses are increasingly not just users of electricity. As the cost of solar panels and batteries has plunged in recent years, people can generate their own power and become suppliers, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sunrun, the nation\u2019s largest residential solar company, said about 20 percent of the solar power systems it installed included batteries, up from 10 percent just a year ago.

Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) last month criticized Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari for his bank's support of a proposed change in the Minnesota constitution that aims to ensure all state students get the best possible education. That followed critiques the senator sent to some of the regional Fed banks last year over their activities on other issues, including climate change and racial inequality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Toomey has contended that some Fed officials have been moving beyond their inflation, employment and financial stability mandates in addressing such issues. He has stressed that the Fed is designed to be apolitical and should operate within the narrow confines laid out by Congress, claiming in letters to several regional Fed banks that their expanded research interests and activities represent \"mission creep.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fed officials have countered that research into these topics informs their understanding of the economy and monetary policy, and that climate-change issues are related to their financial stability mission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Toomey last year asked some of the regional Fed banks for information related to the research work he viewed as out of bounds and hasn't received the documents he sought from the Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis and San Francisco banks, his spokesperson said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spokesperson, Amanda Gonzalez Thompson, said the senator's office received briefings from those banks, but the senator declined offers to speak individually with the four bank presidents until they comply with his document request. She also said the Minneapolis Fed hadn't responded to Mr. Toomey's letter to Mr. Kashkari that criticized the central banker's involvement in the education debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Representatives from the four regional banks said that their briefings, written responses and offers to have their leaders meet with Mr. Toomey were responsive to the senator's request. The banks also said their leaders still stand ready to meet with the senator to discuss his concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Fed's engagement with climate-change issues became a flashpoint in the failed nomination earlier this year of Sarah Bloom Raskin to become the Fed's point person on bank regulation. A number of Republicans joined with Mr. Toomey and expressed concern over her past comments on how aggressively the central bank should act on that front.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regarding the Minnesota education issue, Mr. Toomey called the proposed amendment highly political because \"it wades into an ongoing debate about whether government-run school systems are preferable to parental choice in education.\" He also said it could be used by liberals to challenge education spending levels in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Minneapolis Fed on its website says it is backing the amendment to address educational disparities, and that the proposed change is linked to the Fed's mission, which includes achieving maximum employment, because education plays a large role in job-market success. It also says that the \"amendment does not mandate public school attendance, nor does it affect school choice.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At an event Tuesday, Mr. Kashkari discussed why education is so important to him. The son of highly educated Indian immigrants, he said his parents stressed the importance of schooling. \"Because I got a good education, I feel like every door of this country has been open to me,\" he said, something that he said he wants for everyone. He added that a good education \"pays enormous benefits\" not only to individuals, but to the economy overall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Minneapolis Fed declined to respond to questions about Mr. Toomey's letter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fed observers differ in their views of whether the Fed has gone too far in looking at things beyond meat-and-potatoes economic issues, and whether Mr. Kashkari, who ran for governor in California as a Republican in 2014, has stepped over the line with his education advocacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Randal Quarles, the Fed's top overseer of banks until last year, said this month that \"it's hard to draw the line\" when it comes to appropriate research topics for the regional banks, on the Banking With Interest podcast. But he rejected the idea that the Fed is slipping away from its core mission and said, \"I don't think that the Fed currently is terribly politicized.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kaleb Nygaard, senior research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, said Fed officials have a long history of speaking out on political issues that affect the central bank's work or line up with Fed expertise, and that Mr. Kashkari's education work appears consistent with that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others are less sanguine about the regional Fed banks, which operate under the oversight of the Fed in Washington but are themselves quasi-private institutions whose leaders are not selected via the democratic process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, a recent paper by Carola Binder, an associate professor of economics at Haverford College, and Christina Parajon Skinner, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, tracked research work at the regional banks and found clear increases in topics the authors considered \"activist,\" taking on race, gender and climate subjects. The authors say these topics are harder to connect to the central bank's core mission of controlling inflation and generating job growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Skinner said Mr. Kashkari's work on the education amendment is \"engaging in outright policy advocacy, and in my view, that is sort of just leveraging the reputation, the credibility of the [Fed] system, to pursue these social or economic justice goals that are, I think, certainly outside of the mandate of the Federal Reserve, as established by Congress.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She also said Mr. Kashkari's educational work could be viewed as a goal of the central bank as a whole, even when it isn't. That erodes the Fed's long-stated stance that it is nonpartisan, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>David Beckworth, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University, warned that the shift in Fed focus, including Mr. Kashkari's advocacy, may lead to increased friction with Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said legislators could use what they may see as an activist Fed for their own political goals, believing the old norms have been pushed aside. The central bank could even be used to explicitly finance government projects, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Fed is pushing \"more and more into areas that are at least perceived, maybe unfairly, but perceived as very political, and in doing so it's jeopardizing its independence,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Michael S.

The finding is another indication of the scope of the problem of curbing emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirteen plumes of the gas were observed at the Raspadskya mine, the largest coal mine in Russia, in late January during a single pass of a satellite operated by GHGSat, a commercial emissions-monitoring firm. The total flow rate from all the plumes was estimated at about 87 metric tons (about 95 U.S. tons) an hour.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is the biggest source we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Brody Wight, director of energy, landfills and mines at GHGSat, which was formed in 2011 and now has six emissions-sensing satellites. By contrast, the highest rate measured at Aliso Canyon, a natural gas storage facility in Southern California that had a major leak for nearly four months in 2015 and 2016, was about 60 metric tons an hour.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is a really big fish,\u201d said Felix Vogel, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada in Toronto who is not affiliated with GHGSat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Wight said it was not known how long the releases continued at this rate at the mine. But several previous satellite passes had detected emissions in the tens of tons an hour. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase in what\u2019s coming from this site overall,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Were the flow continuous at 87 metric tons of methane an hour, total yearly emissions would be equivalent to those from five average coal-fired power plants, the company said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Wight said that the releases were most likely deliberate, as the Raspadskya mine, like other coal mines, has naturally occurring methane-rich pockets amid the seams of coal. A buildup of methane at the mine in 2010 led to an explosion that killed 66 people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To reduce methane concentrations, large fans draw air into and through the mine, ventilating the methane into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Methane has more of an effect on warming than carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas emitted by human activities. Over two decades, methane can result in about 80 times the warming of the same amount of carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Methane emissions are far lower than carbon dioxide emissions, and the molecules break down much more rapidly. But because of methane\u2019s warming potential, reducing intentional or accidental emissions of the gas is seen as a way to more quickly limit global warming this century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the global climate talks in Glasgow last fall, more than 100 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030, although Russia and some other large emitters were not among them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until recently, precisely measuring emissions from specific industrial sites like mines, oil and gas production facilities and landfills could only be done using equipment on the ground or in airplanes. That limited the number of sites that could be studied.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While ground and airborne sensing is still conducted, satellites now can easily monitor much bigger areas. Most of these satellites have relatively coarse resolution, however, meaning that while they can detect gas over an area in volumes similar to or greater than that measured at the Russian mine, they cannot narrow the emissions down to specific sites. The GHGSat satellites are among a new generation with much finer resolution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Vogel said that with these newer satellites, \u201cWe have tools now to allow us to get actionable information.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey allow you to really get down to the facility scale, to see specific parts of the facility where emissions are happening,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell companies where to go to fix something.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Dr. Fricker is part of the team that helped identify the calving event, the technical term for the split. She said such events happen roughly every 60 or 70 years. \u201cThe danger with this event is that it shouldn\u2019t be interpreted out of context.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true that atmospheric warming as a result of the greenhouse gasses emitted from burning fossil fuels has contributed to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets around the world, including in Antarctica. Between 2012 and 2016 Antarctica lost 219 billion tons of ice, according to the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. But most of that loss occurred in West Antarctica. D28, by contrast, is in East Antarctica.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ice shelves are floating extensions of glaciers, some of which can cover more than 20,000 square miles of land. Those glaciers shed ice periodically as a way of balancing the weight they gain when snow falls on their centers. Absent that behavior, they would \u201cjust grow and grow and grow \u2014 like not cutting your hair,\u201d said Daniela Jansen, a geophysicist with the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An ice shelf \u201cacts like a cork to hold in the flow of the ice that\u2019s inland of the ice sheet,\u201d said Robert L. Hawley an associate professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College. If too much of the ice shelf is removed during a calving event, it can\u2019t hold back the rest of the sheet anymore, potentially setting it up for a series of collapses. \u201cIt is like you are removing a cork from a champagne bottle,\u201d said Dr. Jansen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the case of D28, which gets its name from a classification system used by the United States National Ice Center, there\u2019s no indication that the ice shelf left behind is unstable. And as for sea level rise, \u201cThe ice has already been afloat for decades so there will be absolutely no impact on sea level,\u201d Adrian Luckman, chairman of the geography department at Swansea University in Wales, said by email.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Geographic events of this scale \u201care fascinating reminders of big things happening in remote corners of the planet, even though they are a natural part of the growth and calving cycle of ice shelves,\u201d said Dr. Luckman, who added that we are in \u201cthe golden age of satellite earth observation.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Being able to track events like this in real time has transformed what we know about the most remote parts of Antarctica, he said, \u201cas well as the rapidity with which these big calving events can be detected and reported upon.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Jay Inslee visited the Seminole Springs mobile home park, the husks of\u00a0cars and houses were still sitting in pools of melted plastic. It had been four months since some of the worst forest fires in southern California's history. Inslee, joined by some of the people who'd lost their homes, was there to explain why man-made climate change was responsible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"When you see this devastation, and you talk to these resilient survivors, it is maddening to think that we have a president who won't protect these people,\" Inslee said. \"It's maddening, because the science is abundantly clear: We will have at least twice as many of these fires in the upcoming decade if we don't act.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Inslee, 68, jumped into the Democratic primary this month as the candidate who would fight climate change.\u00a0His many rivals don't know what to make of that.\u00a0Every Democrat seeking the party's nomination believes that the Earth is warming\u00a0and that Obama-era environmental standards need\u00a0to be fully restored. Every senator and member of Congress in the race had also embraced the Green New Deal, the Marshall Plan-size project to restructure the economy and bring net emissions to zero by 2030. All of them have found that talking about climate change, or about Democrats needing to \"believe in science,\" generates massive applause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Inslee, it looks like other candidates are \"checking a box\" on climate\u00a0\u2014 good intentions and no assurance of action. Inslee, who had watched the Obama administration's cap-and-trade bill to limit pollutants be killed by filibuster in the Senate nine years ago, emphasized that only he was calling for the end of that bill-blocking tool, with no caveats.\u00a0One of just two candidates with experience running a state in the race, Inslee was able to rattle off what his state had done on climate, including a new law that would phase out coal power by 2025 and stop state utilities from burning carbon by 2045. It's the only existential issue in the race, he says; if that makes him a \"single-issue\" candidate, so be it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Look, we didn't\u00a0fight World War II\u00a0by just\u00a0helping the bombed-out cities,\" Inslee told reporters in Agoura Hills.\u00a0\"We fought the enemy. And the enemy here is climate change. It's like December 8, 1941, the morning after Pearl Harbor. Nobody accused Franklin Roosevelt of being a single-issue\u00a0president, because that was the threat. And this threat of climate change threatens everything we hold dear.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Agoura Hills event was the most public part of a short California swing that connected Inslee with Democrats craving a message like this. He met with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who visited early-voting states last year but decided against a run. He raised money with Trevor Neilson, an investor who'd connected with the Inslee campaign after Mike Bloomberg said days earlier that he would not seek the White House. Life, Neilson said, could be separated into two periods\u00a0\u2014 before and after the 2018 fire. Once he evacuated his home, near Agoura Hills, he knew how he wanted to spend his time as a donor and activist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Inslee's the guy,\" said Neilson, 46.\u00a0\"He's 10 times more serious than these people who've jumped on board with the Green New Deal, which is a slogan, not a plan.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Inslee, a cheerful and sometimes jokey politician, talks about climate in apocalyptic terms. When he learned that this reporter\u00a0was on his flight to California, he handed over his copy, just finished, of \"The Uninhabitable Earth.\" It\u00a0describes a future of food scarcity, droughts, dead oceans\u00a0and heat too intense for civilization as we know it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But averting that disaster, according to Inslee, would not need to be painful. Asked what he thought the federal government might limit or tax or ban to change behavior\u00a0\u2014\u00a0gas-powered cars? Meat?\u00a0\u2014 Inslee suggested that enough investment in renewable energy would \"provide multiple choices\" for people to get to work making\u00a0cleaner cars and appliances,\u00a0and develop \"technologies that would allow them to enjoy life as they do now.\" If anyone says he wants to ban automobiles, he points to his \"spiffy, blue\" GM Bolt, an electric vehicle that sells for more than $35,000.\u00a0Republican concerns about overreach, he said, were as frivolous as their assertions that the Affordable Care Act would lead to \"death panels\" for the aged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A\u00a0lot of these Republican politicians, if their house was on fire and the community\u00a0made a bucket brigade to put it out, would say, 'That's socialist,' \" Inslee said. \"They've just got to quit worrying about their ideology and start worrying about their grandchildren a little bit more.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of Inslee's thinking about how to run on climate was informed by the green movement's struggles in Congress. The filibuster was problem No. 1: There was simply no saving the planet, he said, without removing that bottleneck. Asked whether he would use presidential emergency powers to tackle climate change\u00a0and what he would pack into a budget reconciliation bill\u00a0\u2014 the annual opportunity to pass legislation with 51 Senate votes \u2014 he was rueful. He wanted President Trump's emergency declaration to be struck down in court, and he needed Senate rules changed to pass real climate bills. He put it starkly: You could save the planet, or you could worry about the old rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You can't solve this through reconciliation,\" he said. \"There are multiple things, including regulatory actions, that really can't be done through reconciliation. You look at the clean fuel standard,\u00a0you look at\u00a0100 percent [carbon-free] grid,\u00a0you look at banning super pollutants\u00a0\u2014 it's too big a lift. You can't do a major mobilization of the economy through that process.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Inslee's \"war footing\" approach to the issue won him some converts in California. The evacuees in Agoura Hills nodded and occasionally wiped away their tears\u00a0as they blamed the warming climate for what had happened to their communities; they were rueful when they remembered the president saying the problem had been improper raking of the forests, not climate change.\u00a0Inslee, in conversation with the evacuees who'd been invited back for the tour, reminded them that he had written a book about the risks of climate change in 2007\u00a0and that he had been working on the issue in some way or another for his entire career. They were happy to hear it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In the 10 years I lived here, every year, it's getting hotter,\" said Bracken Carter-Webb. \"Climate change has always been in the back of my mind, but after this, it hit home. There are 10 kids on my son's soccer team; five of them lost their homes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Invisible in early polling, Inslee was trying to prove that he simply took those concerns more seriously than other candidates. He had, he told them, wrestled with Republicans enough to learn that it was a waste of time to wait for them on climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have been hoping that the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt would be rekindled in the\u00a0Republican Party, and it hasn't,\" Inslee said after the trailer park visit, talking about a long-ago conservationist focus inside the GOP.\u00a0\"The kind of things that we have to do to mobilize to defeat climate change \u2014 we only have one party that's willing to do it. I wish it were otherwise.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Inslee also separated himself from other Democrats by allowing a super PAC, Act Now on Climate, to raise unlimited money for a campaign that will support him from the outside. The rest of the field has\u00a0denounced super PACs; that, to Inslee, meant \"unilaterally disarming\" and allowing the president to \"beat our eventual nominee over the head\" in 2020.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They are not as committed to defeating climate change as I am,\" Inslee said of his rival Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday's visit made Inslee one of just a few Democrats to visit California, where home-state senator Kamala Harris (D) has won early endorsements from members of Congress and from new Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). Inslee\u00a0intended to compete in the state \"as much as Steph Curry,\" he said, referring to the Golden State Warriors' star. No Democrat would say as much about climate as he, he stressed, no matter who jumped into the race next.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If Joe Biden wrote a book about climate change in 2007, I must have missed it,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats expect Beto O'Rourke to announce a presidential bid soon. He's in Iowa on Saturday to campaign for a state Senate candidate; more telling, he's running more than 100 variations of a Facebook ad that tells supporters to expect an announcement of some sort\u00a0very soon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People in communities across the country have been reaching out and asking me if I'm planning on running in 2020,\" the ad reads. \"Amy and I have made a decision on that. Sign up today to be first to know what's next. I'd like for you to be a part of it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the first ad of any kind O'Rourke has purchased since his defeat four months ago. The variations are key: This sort of A/B message testing is exactly what a campaign operation would do before it seriously heads back out to raise money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three lesser-known Democratic presidential candidates got their own CNN town halls Sunday: John Delaney, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) and Pete Buttigieg. Only one of those candidates, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has released a cash haul from the wake of the debate: $600,000 from 20,000 donors, over just 24 hours. That's real money for a candidate polling at or under 1 percent; it's comparable to what Bobby Jindal, who by 2015 had been a rising GOP star for a decade, put up in his first full quarter as a presidential candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Joe Biden's speech to the International Association of Fire Fighters was, as expected, a show of strength before a group that is expected to endorse him if he runs for president. The ballroom of the Hyatt Regency was filled with \"Run Joe Run\" signs on the union's yellow and black template; Biden himself was framed by massive signs reading \"Fire Fighters for Biden.\" And the former vice president's long tango with the 2020 race continued, with him telling union members that he could need their support in the \"next few weeks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The speech itself, though, did not put much fear into Biden's potential opponents. The first reason was the form of the speech, a series of anecdotes and big themes that did not hang together until the end, when he returned to one of his favorite rhetorical tricks: telling a friendly audience that \"you can knock us down, but you can never beat us.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second was Biden's continued difficulty in making a populist economic argument. It wasn't necessarily the theme of the speech\u00a0\u2014 Biden was there to praise the union and promise permanent protection for firefighters' pensions. But it was noticeable when Biden said that workers, not \"CEOs and hedge funds,\" had built America\u00a0and then, within seconds, added that the CEOs were \"not bad people.\" It's just how Biden talks, especially when he's excoriating the president and needs to pull back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If you've noticed, I get criticized for saying anything nice about a Republican,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"Folks, that's not who we are.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The third and less decorous reason the speech didn't scare other candidates: Biden's presentation. The IAFF, by inviting no other potential or declared 2020 candidates, spared Biden a contrast with a younger Democrat. But it welcomed Biden to the stage with a 90-second video recalling his previous appearances at the conference, a visual aid that could not help but emphasize the age, and slower speaking style, of the Democrat who appeared onstage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic primary is in a strange place, with Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) clearly ahead in state polling\u00a0and rival campaigns completely convinced that their support will fade as voters learn of the \"fresh-faced\" options. Tuesday's speech didn't change Biden's perception of enthusiastic support for a possible candidacy or rivals' perception of that support. His potential opponents could be wrong, but nothing has put the fear into them yet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tulsi Gabbard. She's making a northern California swing this weekend, starting in San Francisco and continuing on to Fremont, also in the Bay Area.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amy Klobuchar. She returns to Iowa this weekend, with three Saturday stops across northeastern, Democratic-leaning cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew Yang. His campaign says it has secured donations from at least 65,000 people; if spread around enough states, that would qualify him for the first Democratic debates. He's also got 14 Iowa and New Hampshire stops coming up before the end of the month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marianne Williamson. \nShe's setting out on a swing through Nevada and New Hampshire, including a St. Patrick's Day celebration in the Las Vegas suburbs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Seth Moulton. He said Tuesday that he favors the end of the electoral college and the filibuster; he is heading to South Carolina next week to suss out support for a presidential bid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was a pivotal week in the Democratic primary \u2014 the first real case of one candidate going on the attack and the other candidate parrying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sunday, former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro attacked Sanders by name, twice. In a CNN interview and subsequent South by Southwest appearance, Castro asked why Sanders was comfortable proposing massive, pricey social welfare and public works projects\u00a0but deferred on questions about reparations for the descendants of slaves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's interesting to me that, when it comes to Medicare-for-all, health care, the response there has been, we need to write a big check,\" Castro told CNN. \"If\u00a0the issue is compensating the descendants of slaves, I don't think that the argument about writing a big check ought to be the argument that you make, if you're making an argument that a big check needs to be written for a whole bunch of other stuff.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Castro's jab was a bit of a test for Sanders; he had, days earlier, said that his campaign would do no opposition research on opponents\u00a0and run no negative ads. And Sanders himself never responded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sanders's network of surrogates did respond. Behind the scenes, negative stories from 2016, about whether Castro's HUD prioritized investors over distressed communities, were quickly recirculated. In public, some well-known Sanders allies went after Castro.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As HUD Sec Castro did more to exacerbate the racial wealth gap than anyone in the Democratic Party over the last few years,\" tweeted Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It wasn't much of a fight; Sanders supporters overwhelmed defenders of Castro online. On Monday, asked about Castro on a conference call, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir largely dismissed the challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a worthy debate; I appreciate all of the candidates offering their thoughts and ideas,\" Shakir said. \"Anyone who tells you they've got a magic bullet here is lying. But the effort to play politics with this does a disservice to the fact that Senator\u00a0Sanders has been a lifelong advocate for racial justice.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Trudeau Scandal Happens All the Time in America,\" by David Dayen</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Have more lax\u00a0corruption laws in the United States made it easier to have government-business collusion\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something that, in other countries, can quickly become an ethical crisis?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many Republicans want a primary fight.

Climate Change Conference gets underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the summit, known as COP27, the administration and its partners will unveil a plan for private companies to finance the energy transition of developing countries, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While government action typically dominates these talks, political paralysis and public pressure are pushing companies to step up with their own emission pledges \u2014 and money to help poorer countries bearing the brunt of climate change's impacts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government funding alone can't cover most of what vulnerable countries need, said John D. Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden on climate change, in an interview. Some $3.8 trillion in annual investment is needed in the next three years to meet the world's climate goals, including reducing emissions and helping nations adapt to the impacts of climate change. Only 16 percent of that money is now flowing, according to a new report from the Rockefeller Foundation and BCG Research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Private-sector capital flows \u2026 that's where the real money is,\" said Podesta, who will be one of the first White House officials to arrive at the negotiations. \"We're talking billions when the need is trillions. We've got to unlock that [private-sector] capacity for people to make investments in building a clean-energy future or else we'll miss both the development goals and the climate goals.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are few expectations for a breakthrough governmental climate deal at this year's summit, one reason corporations are in the spotlight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Anything this hard does not get resolved with a global diplomatic committee,\" said David Victor, co-director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the University of California at San Diego. \"It gets resolved with a small group of highly motivated actors who go off and do stuff and drag everyone else along.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COP27, under U.N. guidelines, is designated to focus on \"implementation\" \u2014 executing past promises to cut emissions. That means that sweeping deals between governments are expected to be harder to come by, as discussions over financing clean-energy and climate-adaptation projects come to the forefront.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many environmentalists are alarmed that the conference will not showcase bolder governmental commitments to slash emissions, and includes so much corporate underwriting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some administration aides have been warning that this financing debate could be politically disastrous for U.S. leaders, according to a person familiar with the planning, although the White House is moving to counter criticism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent weeks, U.S. climate envoy John F. Kerry has been seeking support from other countries and companies to create a clean energy financing scheme to help poorer nations shift away from fossil fuels. Companies would be given credits for assisting this financing, which they could use to offset their own climate emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scale and details of this framework are not yet clear, but Kerry has recently been making the rounds with potential financiers, including a conference late last month in Seattle backed by Bill Gates, followed by one in London. At the Egypt summit, the United States will host a \"call to action\" event during which private companies announce plans for mobilizing capital and technology to help developing nations adapt to climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's announced visit to COP27 will be just a four-hour stopover on Friday, illustrative of how governments view this summit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president might be expected to use this world stage to brag about U.S. passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, but this new law was crafted to be domestically focused, aimed at addressing climate change through hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate tax breaks, grants and loans. It includes few new mandates, and no taxes or other broad-based requirements to guide companies on reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Following COP27, the White House plans to make international aid money a top priority in upcoming budget talks, Podesta said. But for now, it sees reforms to boost climate funding from multilateral development banks and efforts to get private-sector financing as more promising ways to raise the needed capital, he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That may set the stage for friction in Egypt. Leaders in the developing world are frustrated that Biden and other leaders of rich countries have yet to follow through on promises of major government aid, and they have struck a skeptical tone about private-sector financing ahead of the conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At COP27, negotiators are focused on pushing the wealthiest nations to provide help to developing countries, and companies will face renewed pressure to focus their efforts on the global south.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Are we really delivering on climate change, or are we delivering on guarantees to ensure profits for the private sector?\" Egypt's lead climate negotiator, Mohamed Nasr, said to journalists during a preview of the summit. \"The thinking has to change. Investors should be thinking of their climate-positive impacts as part of their assessment of projects and delivery for investors.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One big target is the financial sector and the coalition it formed ahead of last year's climate conference in Glasgow of banks and investment firms pledging that they will invest their assets, now totaling $150 million, in alignment with the world's goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the firms in the group, called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, chafed at a requirement that they phase out financing new fossil fuel projects, in alignment with the U.N. guidelines for curbing warming. The requirement was scrapped, drawing ire from climate organizations that are increasingly focusing their pressure campaigns on companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Companies are stepping up on climate action because of how existential this is for them, but we are going to need to see a much bigger global plan,\" said Peter Lacy, global sustainable services lead at the consulting firm Accenture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About a third of the world's top 2,000 public and private companies have committed to zeroing-out their emissions by 2050, according to Accenture's research. But the firm found that 93 percent of them are on track to miss their targets unless they start moving faster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The outlook was similar from Climate Action 100+, a network of investment groups that tracks the progress of 166 of the world's biggest corporate emitters of greenhouse gas. When the group formed in late 2017, only five of those companies had net-zero targets. Now more than 120 do. But few of those companies now have credible plans for achieving that goal, according to a new report from Climate 100+.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a critical climate summit for these companies,\" said Elizabeth Sturcken, a managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund focused on corporate partnerships. \"We need to see some progress this year and what companies have done with these commitments. They are in the messy part of doing the hard work. I predict we will see some failures, and we will also see some real successes, too.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Morten Bo Christiansen knows how messy the work can be. He leads the decarbonization effort at Maersk, the giant shipping and logistic company that burns through 80 to 90 million barrels of oil per year. The firm has set a goal of zeroing-out its emissions by 2040, making it a favorite point of reference for Kerry and earning it a measure of prestige among the corporations participating at the summit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But making progress on the commitment is complicated amid the lack of clear decarbonization rules from international regulators. The task, Christiansen argues, would be far fairer if there were a carbon tax that gave all companies a uniform incentive to cut emissions, by making the kind of investments Maersk is, in nascent technologies such as barges that run on clean burning methanol made with renewable energy and biomass. \"We need a global solution,\" he said.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

This special edition of the newsletter explains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It could be a game changer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Months of negotiations among Democrats in the Senate produced an agreement on Wednesday to make big investments to get fossil fuels out of the nation\u2019s energy system and nearly meet the pledges that the United States has made under the Paris climate accord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If passed, it would be the largest investment in renewable energy in the history of the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Feeling a bit of whiplash? That\u2019s why we bring you this special edition of the newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement comes two weeks after Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, rejected a similar package, saying he feared it would aggravate inflation. Those worries apparently vanished. The latest package is called the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Manchin\u2019s support is key because Republicans in the evenly divided Senate are opposed. Every single one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What does it contain?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate centerpiece is $369 billion in investments for climate and energy programs. That\u2019s four times bigger than the last climate investment made by the U.S. government in 2009. That package had the effect of lowering the cost of wind and solar energy, and climate advocates said they expected this proposed infusion to significantly lower the costs of producing wind turbines, solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill is aimed at nudging the switch away from the use of oil, gas and coal, which drive global warming when they are burned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my colleagues Lisa Friedman and Brad Plumer wrote, the bill would use tax incentives to promote low-emissions energy industries over the next decade. Companies would receive financial incentives to keep open nuclear plants that might have closed, for instance. Car buyers would receive tax credits to buy electric vehicles. Rebates would be available for those who make their homes more energy efficient or install electric heat pumps or electric water heaters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill would also penalize oil and gas companies that fail to reduce their methane emissions and reward those who do. Methane is a fast-acting greenhouse gas, and methane reductions are seen as the fastest way to slow down the rise of emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about fossil fuel development?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill does not ditch new fossil fuel developments. Otherwise it very likely wouldn\u2019t have won the backing of Mr. Manchin, who has received more money from fossil fuel sector than any other senator.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Manchin said he had won a commitment from his fellow Democrats that they would approve a separate measure to address the process of issuing permits for energy infrastructure, potentially including gas pipelines, in the weeks ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill would also require new lease sales for oil drilling on federal lands and waters, including in the Gulf of Mexico, which environmental groups oppose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both would prolong the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What doesn\u2019t it contain?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The $369 billion energy spending in this bill is smaller than the $555 billion that was in the Build Back Better package, which the House of Representatives passed in November. The new deal also does not back social programs Democrats had championed, like a civilian climate corps, Lisa explained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor does it contain a proposal that Democrats had championed in the past to reward electric utilities that ramp up low-carbon energy and penalize those that don\u2019t.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How does it matter?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in history. It was the only country to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord, albeit briefly. Under the Trump administration, it rolled back a slew of environmental regulations that would have reined in emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Biden Administration rejoined the global accord and promised to reduce U.S. emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This package, according to independent research, wouldn\u2019t go all the way there \u2014 but close. It would reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThat keeps us in the climate fight,\u201d Jesse Jenkins, a professor at the Princeton University School of Engineering, said on Twitter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Britain and the European Union, two large emitters in historical terms, have passed their own climate laws, requiring larger cuts by 2030. Australia\u2019s newly elected government proposed a climate law this week. China, which currently produces the world\u2019s largest share of emissions, has said only that it will peak its emissions by 2030 and then reduce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether these pledges are kept will have a huge bearing on the countries whose emissions continue to grow and will grow much faster in the coming years: big emerging economies like India, Brazil and South Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Essential news from The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preservation using chain saws: With Yosemite\u2019s trees perennially threatened by wildfires, many experts say it\u2019s time to cut and burn protectively.

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres during the summit in Katowice, in Poland's coal country. \"This will allow us to have a regime that is fair and effective for all.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Paris agreement signatories--every country except Syria--failed to reach consensus, however, on more-ambitious targets to curb emissions, putting off the discussion until a summit Mr. Guterres will convene in September on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rulebook is intended to help achieve the goal set out in Paris with transparent reporting requirements for greenhouse-gas emissions and progress toward curbing such releases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Major economies also raised financing levels to combat global warming in developing countries, with Germany and Norway pledging to double contributions to a climate fund that so far has raised more than $10 billion. The money is earmarked to help less-developed nations devise policies and enact projects such as low-emission power generation to reduce their carbon releases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is broad scientific consensus that warming is occurring, and the majority of climate scientists say man-made emissions are at least a significant factor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Negotiators, however, failed to reach a deal on what has been called the \"unsung hero\" of the Paris pact: a global carbon market. That threatens to fragmentize some business-driven efforts to curb rising temperatures and highlights the difficulty in aligning financial interests, even as major entities including China, the European Union and California look to link their carbon markets with the world. Talks will resume at the next annual climate gathering in Chile next November.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have reached a balanced deal on the rules to turn the Paris agreement into action,\" Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the EU's climate chief, said at the end of the summit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Katowice gathering was a far cry from the Paris summit and characterized by an increasing number of countries following President Trump in questioning the climate accord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the first day, Turkey held up proceedings, requesting a change of status from developed country to developing in an effort to tap billions in climate financing pledged by advanced economies. Last year, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey wouldn't ratify the accord until it secured funds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brazil introduced language to the draft rulebook that effectively derailed an agreement on creating an international carbon market, officials and environmental organizations at the talks said. The Environmental Defense Fund, a large nonprofit organization, said the proposal amounted to a \"poison pill\" that would render the Paris pact obsolete by double-counting emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. shift, following Mr. Trump's June 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, was evident. A lead architect of the Paris deal under the Obama administration, the U.S. in Katowice hosted an event on the sidelines to promote fossil fuels, including coal. Washington also joined Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait in weakening a motion to welcome the U.N. climate report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability,\" Mr. Trump's senior adviser on energy and climate affairs, Wells Griffith, said in Katowice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protesters disrupted Mr. Griffith's speech, unfurling a banner depicting oil- and gas-drilling wells and chanting \"keep it in the ground.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the top-level pushback against the Paris accord, U.S. negotiators have been instrumental in driving efforts toward completing a rulebook to govern the pact, other participants said.

He hopes to announce further progress with China on climate change, which has become a rare bright spot in an otherwise fraught relationship. But his drive to reassert the United States' presence in Asia has been jeopardized by a political backlash against his ambitious trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, the president began his travels by focusing on climate change on the American side of the Pacific Rim. On his way to Asia, he stopped at Lake Tahoe, on the Nevada-California border, and in Hawaii to speak at two conferences dedicated to conservation and environmental preservation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The challenges of conservation and combating climate change are connected. They are linked,\" Mr. Obama told a large crowd at a casino amphitheater under the dry, fire-prone peaks of the Heavenly ski resort at Lake Tahoe. Several hours later, Mr. Obama arrived in Hawaii, where he addressed leaders of Pacific Island nations, several of whom face the prospect of rising seas swallowing their homes and native lands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Few people understand the stakes better than our Pacific Island leaders, because they're already seeing the impact,\" Mr. Obama said at the East-West Center, an education and research organization in Honolulu. He noted that rising seas had driven villagers from their homes in Fiji and led Kiribati to buy property elsewhere for the day when that country vanishes beneath the waves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama repeated his criticism of those who deny the science of climate change. But he has sought to reframe the debate over climate change around issues like conservation and environmental protection, officials said, because they are more accessible than scientific discussions of carbon emissions -- and perhaps less polarizing, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama's Hawaii stop set the stage for a trip on Thursday to the remote Pacific atoll of Midway, which sits within a protected marine national monument that Mr. Obama announced last week he would quadruple in size to more than half a million square miles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president has long wanted to visit Midway, part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which was designated in 2006. He is trading his regular Air Force One for a smaller plane that can land at Midway's remote runway, not far from where one of the most fateful naval battles of World War II was fought in the Pacific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, it is on to Hangzhou, China, for a Group of 20 summit meeting, where Mr. Obama hopes to announce that he and President Xi Jinping have both agreed to put the Paris climate accord into effect. That legal step could galvanize its worldwide enforcement since their two countries account for 40 percent of global emissions. Administration officials said the two sides were still working out the final details.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China has continued to find common ground with the United States on climate, even as the two sides fall out over computer hacking, trade, and China's aggressive claims in the South China Sea. Analysts said they expected sharp words between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi over the South China Sea, particularly in the wake of China's repudiation of a tribunal ruling in The Hague that invalidated its broad maritime claims there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama also plans to make an ardent case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a 12-nation trading pact that does not include China. Officials said he would emphasize the deal's benefits on his final stop in Laos, where he will attend a gathering of Southeast Asian countries, several of which have signed on to the agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he is holding a weak political hand at home. The two major party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, have both come out against the agreement, and support for free trade is fraying, even in the normally pro-trade Republican Party. Congressional leaders have made it clear the deal will not come up for a vote before the election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama will most likely find himself educating Asian leaders in the fine points of the lame-duck session, which now looms as the last chance during his presidency for a Congressional vote. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, insisted there was a reservoir of popular support for the T.P.P. and that Asian leaders, as astute interpreters of American politics, would look past the hostile positions of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, administration officials are cleareyed about what a defeat, or even long-term stalling of the agreement, would mean for Mr. Obama's effort to reinvigorate America's presence in Asia. With its vast scope -- ending 18,000 tariffs and nontariff barriers imposed by Japan, Australia, and other countries against American produce -- the agreement has become the centerpiece of the president's Asian focus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"T.P.P. is, in many ways, seen as a litmus test for whether or not the U.S. has staying power in this region,\" Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said to reporters on Monday. \"What the countries of the Asia-Pacific region want to know, particularly the Asian countries, is whether or not we can be counted on.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Clinton's unyielding opposition has been particularly troubling to Asian leaders, analysts said, given that she spoke out regularly in favor of the agreement when she was secretary of state. \"I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president,\" she said last month at a campaign rally in Michigan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Asian leaders believe that Mrs. Clinton would happily carry out the T.P.P. if it were approved before her inauguration, as do some members of the Obama administration. Others believe she will reverse her position if a few elements of the pact are tweaked. But as she has dug in her heels, such a reversal is harder to contemplate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They are starting to realize that if it doesn't get through in the lame duck, it will be very hard for her to pivot back to the position she had as secretary of state,\" said Michael J. Green, an expert on Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a trans-Pacific trip by President Obama referred incorrectly to the creation of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which Mr. Obama plans to visit on his way to Asia.

That's the latest scuttlebutt from state-owned news service Xinhua, which noted that the levy would be part of a broader effort to improve the country's environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to see why this move is attracting so much attention. China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Yet the country has earned a reputation for bogging down international efforts to tackle climate change. A carbon tax looks like a big about-face. And it's more than anything Congress is proposing right now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the details matter a lot here. Some experts think China's carbon tax may be too small and loophole-ridden to make much difference on emissions, at least in the beginning. On the other hand, a carbon tax also isn't the only thing China is doing to try to rein in its pollution. So here are a few things to consider:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1) China's carbon tax is likely to be small at first. Chinese officials have offered hints about the size of the tax. Back in 2011, its Finance Ministry proposed a levy that would start at 10 yuan ($1.60) per ton of carbon and rise to 50 yuan ($8) per ton by 2020. (The Environment Ministry has pushed for a tax worth about twice that.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To put that in perspective, the proposal would initially add less than $1 to the price of a ton of coal, rising to about $4.40 by 2020. Coal in China currently trades for around $86.50 a ton. So it's a modest first step.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2) Any carbon-tax regime in China would probably have loopholes. Ella Chou of Brookings has a great post thinking through how a carbon tax in China would actually work. Right now, China's provinces levy a \"fee\" on various industries to pay for environmental damages. In practice, this fee often just gets waived. So the government in Beijing is proposing to replace the fee with a \"tax\" that's harder to evade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in practice, Chou notes, the provincial governments could still find loopholes to blunt the pain for local industries. \"Local governments would continue to come up with ways to give industries tax rebates and subsidies to attract them to their own jurisdictions,\" she writes, \"so the effect of the environmental tax or the carbon tax on the industries would be negligible.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3) Much of the cost of China's carbon tax would be borne by other countries. Last year, John Lee of the Center for International Security Studies argued that any carbon tax in China would mostly fall on the country's exporters, who would in turn pass the cost on to consumers in the United States and Europe. \"Beijing has consistently argued that the end-consumer country, and not the producer country, should bear the burden of paying for carbon emissions,\" Lee notes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, that's still a significant step. Export manufacturing is responsible for anywhere from 20 percent to 50 percent of China's greenhouse-gas emissions, after all. But it does help explain why Chinese officials are relatively sympathetic to this idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4) China's carbon tax is still larger than anything Congress is considering. Although U.S. carbon emissions are falling at the moment, many analysts think we'll ultimately need a price on carbon to ensure the trend continues. Last week, Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled a bill that would impose a carbon tax in the United States starting at $20 per ton. Most observers think this won't pass anytime soon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5) In theory, a bigger, well-designed carbon tax could curb China's emissions significantly. Okay, let's set the worries about loopholes aside. Could a well-designed carbon tax make a difference to China's emissions? In theory, at least? Perhaps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A recent study (pdf) from the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning found that a bigger carbon tax, starting at 50 yuan ($8) per ton of carbon today and rising to 75 yuan ($12) per ton in 2020, could actually have a significant impact. China's greenhouse-gas emissions would grow at a much slower rate than projected:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Again, though, this is all in theory, without worrying about poor enforcement and loopholes and the like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>6) China is announcing other actions besides the carbon tax to curb its pollution. But, again, the details are a big question mark. David Roberts had a good rundown of the Chinese government's recent proposal to cap the country's coal consumption at 4 billion tons. That would still mean China consumes as much coal as the rest of the world combined. But at least its appetite would no longer be expanding endlessly:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On top of that, China recently announced plans to impose new air-pollution limits on coal, steel, cement, metal and petrochemical industries in 47 major cities. The move came after smog in Beijing rose to record levels in January.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So the government is proposing more than just a carbon tax. But, again, the big question is implementation. For the past decade, China's central government has often proposed bold environmental initiatives that get thwarted by the provinces -- the latter tend to put a higher priority on economic growth. I wrote about that dynamic at length a few years back, and it's one reason to be at least mildly skeptical anytime China makes a big environmental announcement.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

To water resiliency advocates who are attending the United Nations conference, the river's plight stands out as one of the world's starkest cases of a major water source that is being ravaged by the altered climate, where efforts to adapt haven't been nearly enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"To me, it is the best example globally of how things can go badly,\" said John Matthews, executive director and co-founder of the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation. \"I can easily point to the Colorado as a place where we only have hard choices now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His group is one of a number of nongovernmental organizations participating in a series of water discussions, including talks on how humanity can adapt to a climate of supercharged floods and droughts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matthews said the water shortage on the Colorado River reflects fundamental problems in how Hoover Dam and other infrastructure projects were designed for a climate that no longer exists, and how water supplies continue to be divided under a rigid and antiquated system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We had a profound amount of ecological and hydrological hubris in how we designed things then, and how for the most part we still design things now,\" Matthews said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That extends to the legal structure of how the river is divided among seven states and Mexico. The river has long been overallocated under the 1922 Colorado River Compact and subsequent agreements.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Colorado Compact is trapped in a climate that went away in 1980 or 1990, and is not coming back for at least another millennium,\" Matthews said. \"I think this is an old car without air bags.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, Hoover Dam and the giant canals that were built across the desert facilitated rapid population growth and economic development in the Southwest, from Los Angeles to Phoenix.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And just as the U.S. water system was planned and built based on assumptions about how much water would be available from Rocky Mountain snowmelt, Matthews said, similar challenges now face countries including Ethiopia, China, Turkey and Brazil as they plan water infrastructure projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The water level in Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, has dropped this year to its lowest point since Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s. The reservoir near Las Vegas now stands at just 34% of full capacity, and the federal government has declared a shortage on the Colorado River for the first time. That has triggered water cutbacks next year for Arizona, Nevada and Mexico. Farmers in parts of Arizona are bracing for reductions and planning to leave some fields dry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cuts could soon affect California too if the reservoir continues to decline as projected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists estimate that about half the decrease in runoff in the watershed since 2000 was caused by unprecedented warming. And this heat-driven erosion of the water supply is projected to worsen as temperatures continue to climb.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The story of climate change on the Colorado is really a story about less snow,\" said Zach Frankel, executive director of the Salt Lake City-based Utah Rivers Council. \"Climate change is increasing winter air temperatures, which are resulting in less snow in the Utah, Colorado and Wyoming mountains that lead to less melted snowpack water that flows into the river.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's very serious that these reservoirs are so low,\" Frankel said, speaking of Lake Mead and Lake Powell. \"It's akin to having overdrawn our savings account and now being out of money.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Discussions about water are taking on a higher profile at the annual U.N. climate meeting, formally called the 26th gathering of the Conference of Parties, or COP26, in Glasgow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new water pavilion features a series of livestreamed discussions about water solutions. Announcing these events, Matthews and other organizers said they want to boost awareness about water's central role in the climate crisis, and the need for action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Attendees at the conference are talking about strategies such as designing water infrastructure for new climate extremes, working with nature to restore floodplains and wetlands, capturing flood flows to recharge depleted groundwater, and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from pumping and treating water. They're also sharing ideas about planning for more intense floods and droughts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Water is the main bleeding edge for climate adaptation, where people and economies are going to be hurt,\" said conference attendee Felicia Marcus, a visiting fellow at Stanford University and former chair of California's state water board. \"It's where you feel the impacts of climate change first.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marcus said COP26 could be pivotal \"for water taking its rightful place as a core issue,\" and for countries to more fully incorporate water adaptation strategies in their climate policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because many people are talking more about \"water resilience\" lately, researchers at the Pacific Institute in Oakland wrote a paper presenting a definition of the term. They defined water resilience as \"the ability of water systems to function so that nature and people, including those on the front lines and disproportionately impacted, thrive under shocks, stresses, and change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the shrinking Colorado River, Marcus said, it's become \"a very potent symbol of what's to come, and what's happening in other places around the world.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lake Mead's retreating shorelines became a backdrop representing the need for climate action last month when Vice President Kamala Harris visited to push for the Biden administration's infrastructure and climate plans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around Lake Mead, a federally managed national recreation area that attracts more than 8 million visitors each year, the low water levels have already hurt some locals who rely on the reservoir for boating and fishing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The water levels have been dropping every year,\" said Eric Richins, a Kingman, Ariz.-based boat operator whose company, Big Water Boating, leads fishing tours on Lake Mead. \"It's harder to access Lake Mead because the ramps you'd usually use are closed because of the low water levels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2019, the seven states that rely on the river reached a set of agreements intended to reduce the risks of reservoirs declining to dangerously low levels. Under that seven-year deal, California, Arizona and Nevada agreed to a series of water reductions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But after two hot and extremely dry years, water officials in the three states have acknowledged that those steps won't be sufficient. They've been meeting to consider next steps, which could include additional cutbacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some scientists have estimated the Colorado could lose about one-fourth of its flow by 2050 as temperatures continue to rise. In other research, federal scientists have studied the base flow, or the movement of groundwater into streams in the watershed. They've projected that hotter, drier climate could lead to a 29% decline in base flow in the Upper Colorado River Basin by the 2050s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest studies add to warnings that scientists have been raising for years about how climate change is affecting the river. And some warnings came decades ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Activists with the group Climate Investigations Center have pointed to an internal Exxon memo written in 1979 about a study by an intern on the potential effects of rising carbon dioxide levels. In a bulleted list summarizing other published research on the environment effects of higher CO2 levels, the report stated: \"The flow of the Colorado River would diminish and the southwest water shortage would become much more acute.\" The document has been cited in court cases against oil companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the river's reservoirs continuing to decline, members of Congress convened hearings last month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Entsminger, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, explained what he called the \"math problem\" on the river.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we rely upon the promises of the 1920s and the 1940s, there are legal entitlements to 17.5 million acre-feet of water each year. Annual use today is approximately 14 million acre-feet. And over the last 20 years, the river has given us an average of 12.3 million acre-feet,\" Entsminger told the House water subcommittee. \"There is more and more evidence on the ground that what the Colorado River is actually facing is not drought but aridification and a permanent transition to a drier future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of tribes also spoke. Daryl Vigil of the Jicarilla Apache Nation in New Mexico, a co-facilitator of the Water and Tribes Initiative, said Indigenous tribes have long been left out of the decision-making process on the river and need to be at the table.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Tribes have senior water rights to at least 25% of the current natural flow of the Colorado River but have historically been excluded from decision-making or 'consulted' only after decisions have been made,\" Vigil said in written testimony. \"It is time to create a new paradigm for governing the use of the Colorado River -- one that integrates best available science and Indigenous knowledge of the basin. And one that involves tribes as active partners.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Others emphasized the importance of stepping up the pace of talks on additional measures, saying the government hasn't put in place a default plan if the states don't reach a collaborative agreement quickly enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The point I want to emphasize is the need for speed,\" said Anne Castle, a senior fellow at the University of Colorado law school and a former Interior Department official. \"It's just not clear that the river will allow the current pace of discussions to continue without devastating consequences.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: THE COLORADO RIVER, a vital source of drinking water for 40 million people, flows near Moab, Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Luis Sinco Los Angeles Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO:THE COLORADO churns through the Imperial Irrigation Dam, which diverts water to Arizona and California.

The coal plant continues to generate electricity and emit carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carbon-capture projects are attracting renewed attention from investors and governments world-wide as concerns mount about the greenhouse-gas emissions linked to climate change. But the initiatives have a dismal record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than 80% of proposed commercial carbon-capture efforts around the world have failed, primarily because the technology didn't work as expected or the projects proved too expensive to operate, according to a 2020 study by researchers at Canada's Carleton University, the University of California, San Diego and other institutions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. has spent $1.1 billion on carbon-capture demonstration projects since 2009, with uneven results, according to a December report from the Government Accountability Office. None of the eight coal projects selected for $684 million of the funding during that time is operating, the researchers found. Projects to capture carbon from heavy industries met with some success.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some early projects have demonstrated that it is technologically possible to collect carbon from power plants and industrial sites\u2014or even directly out of the air\u2014they have generally been very expensive. Many face a fundamental problem: there is no economic use for the carbon they capture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Currently, the only large-scale use for captured carbon is for pushing more oil and gas out of declining reservoirs, which in turn leads to additional emissions when the fossil fuels are burned for energy. In the U.S., there is no federal requirement that companies capture carbon emissions, or carbon taxes or other fees aimed at discouraging them from releasing the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, most carbon-capture initiatives don't save companies money or generate profits, and they represent an added business expense. Still, some companies are pursuing the projects to reduce their carbon footprint under pressure from investors and activists concerned about climate change .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A fresh round of U.S. carbon-capture projects is in the works, bolstered by around $12.1 billion in funding in the $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law last year by President Biden. Oil, power, chemicals and biofuels companies are kicking off a wave of new proposed carbon-capture investments, including carbon-transport pipelines in Iowa, a coal-power plant in North Dakota and a hydrogen plant in Louisiana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Large fossil-fuel companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. are touting carbon capture as a part of their future plans to reduce emissions \u2014and lobbying Congress to increase a tax credit to make the projects more economically sustainable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many companies and climate activists say governments need to nurture innovative technologies to capture emissions that would otherwise be hard to cut. Accelerating such projects, they argue, is the only realistic way to reach the targets of the international Paris agreement , which seeks to keep rising temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"To meet the goals of the Paris climate accords, there's no way we can do it without direct-air capture,\" Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in an interview. The company, which uses carbon to extract oil, plans to build facilities to capture it straight from the air, but considers the potential tax-credit expansion vital to its efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon is proposing a project with other companies in Houston to capture and bury the carbon from an array of industries. But it would be difficult to launch at its proposed size without policy changes such as a larger tax credit, said Erik Oswald, a vice president at Exxon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress is considering boosting the credit for collecting carbon emissions from smokestacks by 70% to $85 for a metric ton if the carbon is stashed in saline geologic formations, or $60 if it is sent down oil wells. Direct air projects would get $180 for a metric ton if the carbon is stored, or $130 for oil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Less generous tax credits have been on the books since 2008 but have failed to create a real carbon-capture industry. \"There's been little material impact on the deployment of carbon capture and storage,\" said Scott Anderson, senior director of energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, a U.S.-based advocacy group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The infrastructure bill included funding for pipelines and storage to help build a missing puzzle piece: a spider's web of infrastructure that could gather and ship carbon from multiple sites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That's a massive step forward for carbon capture and carbon storage,\" said Cindy Crane, chief executive of Enchant Energy Corp., which plans to retrofit a coal-fired power plant in New Mexico with carbon-capture equipment for around $1.3 billion. The project would also require up to roughly $390 million in plant improvements, a pipeline and storage field.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Globally, industries will have to raise carbon-capture capacity by a factor of 50 to 100 times over what is in the development pipeline to achieve what the International Energy Agency estimates is needed to reach \"net-zero\" carbon emissions by 2070, said John Bradford, professor of geophysics and vice president for global initiatives at the Colorado School of Mines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Building those projects\u2014and keeping them running\u2014can be costly. Petra Nova was a joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corp. that captured some emissions from a coal plant near Houston and piped them about 80 miles to an oil field, where they were used to push more crude out of the ground. The government awarded the project around $195 million in a proof-of-concept grant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Petra Nova closed in 2020 after the pandemic reduced demand for fuel and led to a collapse in oil prices, which made the oil that the captured carbon was helping produce less economically viable. It remains in mothball status, though NRG said it proved the technology could work on a coal-fired plant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We continue to explore options to improve the economics,\" said NRG spokesman Chris Rimel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mississippi, a carbon-capture initiative by utility Southern Co. has turned into a white elephant. The project known as Kemper aimed to use locally mined lignite coal to fuel a power plant, and capture the resulting carbon emissions, which were then to be sent to oil fields to prime crude production. The Energy Department invested $387 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forecast to cost $3 billion in 2010, Kemper's costs spiraled above $7 billion . Once constructed, the coal-gasification technology never quite worked as intended, and Southern abandoned its initial plans , burning natural gas in the power plant instead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The company imploded coal and carbon-capture equipment that couldn't be dismantled for resale last October. Coal conveyors from Kemper are now available for sale online.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It was the end of a long, bad experiment,\" said Mississippi Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley, a Kemper critic. Mr. Presley said he favors innovation but believes government and business should bear the risk instead of utility ratepayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Presley and other regulators didn't allow Southern to pass Kemper's full cost on to customers. The company, which had to assume some $6 billion on the project's cost, is paying for demolition of the carbon-capture part, estimated at $10 million to $20 million annually through 2025, said a spokesman for Mississippi Power, the utility arm behind the project.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The federal government is now funding a $24 million feasibility study that includes the same plant\u2014this time for capturing and storing carbon emissions from natural gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Jennifer Hiller at jennifer.hiller@wsj.com and Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Projects to Capture Carbon Emissions Get New Boost Despite Dismal Record</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jennifer Hiller and Collin Eaton\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

It is certain to spark a high-stakes legal and political battle that will echo through the November midterm election and beyond.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents -- including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the mining industry and congressional Republicans and Democrats from coal-producing states -- have already lined up against it. Critics labeled it government overreach that would do little to reduce climate change while costing tens of billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Now the president is once again looking to do through regulation what he couldn't accomplish through legislation. But myself and others are sounding the real alarm of how the president's plan will be dangerous for our economy and future job opportunities,\" said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), citing a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report that estimated the rule could cost the economy $50 billion annually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But environmental groups and other administration allies applauded the proposal as crucial to efforts to cut the single greatest source of greenhouse gases. Power plants account for an estimated 40% of all carbon dioxide emissions in the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who took part in a conference call with Obama and other key officials late Sunday, praised the plan because it gives states and regions flexibility to meet the emission targets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This allows economies to adjust and transform over time in a very aggressive way but a very realistic way,\" said Schatz, who has made climate change a signature issue since he joined the Senate in 2012.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is becoming a consensus, rational position for people of all parties across the country,\" Schatz said. \"Republicans are on the wrong side of history here. That's going to become clear not just over the long run but over the next couple of elections.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rule would allow states to offset their carbon emissions by developing other parts of the power grid, including greater energy efficiency or increased use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The reality of it is that we will have to build and invest in renewables,\" said Lisa Bonnett, director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 30% cut will be based on 2005 emission levels, which were 10% higher than in 2012. The decline stems from the recent boom in cleaner-burning natural gas, which has displaced a great deal of coal as a fuel source.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, each state would have a different target, based on its fuel mix.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States that burn a lot of coal would begin their reductions from a higher emissions level than those that burn natural gas, which emits less carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because the rule has not been officially issued, the 30% reduction could be one of several options the EPA presents for public comment, environmentalists said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama telephoned a group of Senate and House Democrats to thank them for their support in advance of Monday's announcement by Gina McCarthy, head of the EPA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If enacted, the rule would make good on a pledge Obama made last year to tackle climate change through his executive authority in the face of congressional inaction on the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Domestic opponents of unilateral U.S. action argue that climate change is a global problem that requires emissions cuts from all major polluters, especially newly industrializing giants China, India and Brazil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rule's backers say a strong curb on greenhouse gas emissions could give U.S. negotiators more leverage at the next major United Nations meeting to address climate change, scheduled for 2015 in Paris.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said an ambitious U.S. carbon standard would lead to \"stronger agreements for similar reductions from China, India and Brazil.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Christiana Figueres, who heads the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, seemed to agree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The decision by President Obama to launch plans to more tightly regulate emissions from power plants will send a good signal to nations everywhere that one of the world's biggest emitters is taking the future of the planet and its people seriously,\" she said in a statement. \"I fully expect action by the United States to spur others in taking concrete action.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama pledged after he was first elected that, by 2020, the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions 17% from 2005 levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in mid-2010, Congress defeated an ambitious package of \"cap and trade\" climate change measures that would have imposed deep cuts on the production of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats from fossil-fuel-producing states have denied that human activity is behind the rapid warming of the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the White House retooled its climate strategy in the second term to bypass Congress with piecemeal measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the carbon standard is the most sweeping, it's not the first.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In September, the EPA proposed rules to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. The stringent limits, which will be completed in January, would all but ensure a halt in new construction of coal-fired plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year, the administration announced tougher fuel economy standards for heavy-duty, long-haul trucks that complement existing fuel efficiency rules for cars and light trucks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>neela.banerjee@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Evan Halper, Michael A.

They plan to tell them that climate change is fueling a need for greater disaster relief and humanitarian aid, while stirring political instability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The message reflects an increased effort within the Obama administration to persuade both the U.S. public and other governments that the extreme weather events linked to climate change are putting at risk major swaths of the world's population, even as polling shows most U.S. residents don't see it as an urgent issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Climate change is not just an environmental problem, it's an economic and security problem as well,\" said John Podesta, senior counselor to President Barack Obama. \"That's why it's significant that Secretary Hagel and Administrator Shah have made climate change an integral part of the Asean defense ministers' forum in Hawaii this week.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The meeting marks the first time the U.S. has hosted the group, and comes as the Pentagon is trying to revamp its purpose in tight budgetary times and as more than a decade of costly overseas land wars come to an end this year as the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close. The Pentagon is putting more emphasis on disaster relief and humanitarian aid missions as new priorities, and defense officials mentioned last year's response to Typhoon Haiyan as an example of the emerging dangers created by climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have put this on the map as one of our missions that we have to address,\" said a senior defense official.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. military provided significant support to the Philippines in the aftermath of the typhoon, and they are holding up that disaster response as an example of what they will need to do more of in the coming years. The Pentagon has embraced a number of steps to address climate change issues, such as how rising ocean levels will impact U.S. military coastal bases around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Hagel's warnings, which are part of Mr. Obama's broader climate agenda announced last June, come in the wake of a new report released Monday by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that underscored how climate change is exacerbating droughts, wildfires and flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As this week's IPCC report made plain, because of climate change, the world will experience more floods and fires, more sea level rise, more severe weather, more food insecurity, and more refugees, all of which act as accelerators of violent conflict,\" Mr. Podesta said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, has spoken extensively on climate change only one other time since he became secretary in February 2013. The Pentagon has made it a priority since 2010 when it first identified climate change as a national-security threat in its Quadrennial Defense Review, a document released every four years that drives the military's strategic objectives and identifies national-security threats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The military and the U.S.'s international aid agency, USAID, prioritize climate change because of its ripple effects on populations around the globe -- what the military calls a \"threat multiplier.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its latest Quadrennial Defense Review released in early March, Pentagon officials wrote: \"The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economics, societies, and governance institutions around the world.\" It said the effects \"are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions-conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The military's take on climate change doesn't get a lot of attention on Capitol Hill, but it drew the ire of Sen. John McCain, (R., Ariz.), ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in February when he chided Secretary of State John Kerry for calling climate change a \"weapon of mass destruction\" during a speech in Indonesia. Mr. McCain contrasted that with the Syrian conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Why should he talk about climate change when we've got 130,000 people in Syria killed,\" Mr. McCain said in an interview with a Phoenix radio station. \"So he has to go over to Asia and talk about climate change and say it's the most important issue? Hello? On what planet does he reside?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokesman for Mr. McCain declined to comment on this week's expected attention to climate change at the Hawaii meeting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change isn't a big concern among Americans. In a series of Gallup polls released in March, climate change ranked second-to-last in respondents' list of their top 15 worries. The percentage of people--57%--who acknowledge the scientific consensus that humans' burning of fossil fuel is a main cause of climate change is at the highest level since 2007. Even still, 42% think the media exaggerates the seriousness of the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Amy Harder\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

It towers above all other trees in our forests, with a canopy that can grow as high as 230 feet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My people, the Bribri, have always looked at our Ceibas with awe and respect. Rich nations now look at them and see an opportunity to atone for their climate sins. After decades and decades of fossil fuel use, they can now buy into carbon credit markets, paying communities like mine to keep tropical forests safe. We use the money to, for example, hire rangers who can patrol the edges of our lands and guard against illegal logging, mining and farming operations, thus preventing the deforestation that is a major source of climate-warming emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Companies that have their own pledges to cut their emissions can also join in on these markets. They direct large sums of money through brokerage firms that often use the role of Indigenous people as a selling point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the United Nations climate conference in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, last month, one of the most contentious debates was around fair rules for the new carbon trading system that is expected to start in 2024 as part of the Paris climate agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the negotiations failed to create any new rules and safeguards, leaving in place a system in which Indigenous communities can easily be \u2014 and already are being \u2014 exploited. Of particular concern is a provision that allows countries to keep information about carbon credit projects confidential. That\u2019s why going forward the U.N. body that will oversee carbon markets must require that any proposal for partnering with Indigenous people begins with recognition of our land rights, transparency about project details and a consultation process with communities \u2014 the only guarantee that our forests will remain standing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current lack of regulation and clear rules has given rise to carbon cowboys \u2014 brokers who have descended on Indigenous communities in Honduras, Brazil and Colombia and talked them into signing away their rights to the carbon in their forests, and in turn the payments that can come with them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At their worst, carbon cowboys are companies and individuals who set their own rules, forging agreements with Indigenous people that undermine land rights and deny communities the right to give (or deny) their consent to participate in the carbon credit market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The international community has called for \u201chigh integrity\u201d carbon markets that both reduce emissions and protect against exploitation. But that is possible only when the people who have deep spiritual and cultural links to the forest are directly involved.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even brokers that proclaim their high ethical standards often come up short on actual protections. LEAF Coalition is a public-private initiative that has received more than $1.5 billion from corporations like H&M, Volkswagen, Amazon, Unilever and BlackRock. LEAF says it ensures \u201cthe highest levels of environmental integrity and social safeguards, particularly for Indigenous peoples and local communities.\u201d But in practice, it offers no discernible guarantees for Indigenous rights on the ground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental integrity is embedded in Indigenous languages and passed down from one generation to the next. It is rooted in our sense of place by culture, custom and spirituality. It is fundamental to our identity. We are the eyes and the ears on the ground, and we know if the forest is being threatened. We are the key to ensuring that the carbon stays here in the forest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carbon credit brokers have said that the speed of climate change doesn\u2019t allow for us to be part of the consultation process. But we can\u2019t be just observers and commentators if it has anything to do with our forest. We need a seat at the table.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our elders, women and youth want to understand what is being proposed. It may not happen as quickly as these brokers would like. But these new relationships between the richest corporations in the world and poor communities like mine must also be about participation, rights and cultural knowledge. The common goal should not be about covering up environmental sins but rather finding solutions to the climate problem we face together.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Levi Sucre Romero is a member of the Bribri Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica and the coordinator of the Mesoamerican Alliance of People and Forests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Whether they  have the stomach for adding a food fight to the list remains  uncertain. But the possibility that climate-change politics could  affect nutrition guidelines serves as a reminder of how many parts  of daily life the struggle to limit global warming can reach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We can't solve the climate problem with just what we are doing  with fossil fuels and energy,\" said Doug Boucher, director of  climate research at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is  lobbying for changing the pyramid. \"Food is a big part of it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Food Pyramid is just the latest function of government where  climate change looms large after years of not being a  consideration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legions of military officers are focused on shifting the nation's  fighting force to clean energy, hoping to not only limit global  warming, but also save money and reduce the need for huge,  vulnerable oil supply lines. The Department of Housing and Urban  Development is pushing a green building portfolio. Even the  Department of Education is required to regularly produce a  climate-change action plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the stakes are high when it comes to steak. The dietary  guidelines embodied in the pyramid are the core of the nation's  food policy. And although the nation's epidemic of obesity raises  questions about how much the guidelines affect public behavior,  they do shape billions of dollars of government programs, including  school lunches to food stamps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental and animal rights groups see the discussion of the  role food plays in climate change as an opportunity to reach a vast  new group of Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People care a lot more about their own personal health than they  do about the environment or animal welfare,\" said Michael Jacobson,  executive director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest  in Washington.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"So these groups are hoping to make progress on their issues by  linking them to healthier diets.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A revamp of the food pyramid to take climate into account would be  a bold step. Despite a major push by the United Nations for  countries to rework dietary policies with an eye on climate impact,  none have. The Netherlands is expected to be the first when it  releases a new food-guidelines chart later this year, said Kate  Clancy, a longtime sustainability advocate who advised the federal  panel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a way to get people to think about how their food is  produced,\" Clancy said. \"We should not be making it seem like there  is no connection between what you eat and its impact on the  planet.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hoping to nudge governments, advocacy groups have been busily  designing mock-ups of what a revamped food pyramid would look like.  A rendering by the Italy-based Barilla Center for Food and  Nutrition has the traditional pyramid alongside an upside down  \"Environmental Pyramid.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beef ranks as the least healthy and least environmentally sound  food on both charts. Cookies, however, are unhealthy for your body,  but not necessarily the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Differences like that provide talking points for critics of a  sustainability-focused pyramid. Nutritional guidance, they say, is  already confusing enough for consumers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It is becoming harder and harder for the public to figure out what  the scientists are saying with this document,\" said Marshall Matz,  an attorney who was chief counsel to the Senate agriculture  committee when it wrote the nation's first dietary guidelines in  the late 1970s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matz is no climate skeptic. Despite his misgivings about tinkering  with the pyramid, he says the concerns the sustainability advocates  raise about the food system are very real.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional Republicans and cattle ranchers disagree. Last year's  House Agriculture Committee chairman, Rep. Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma  Republican whose congressional district includes huge tracts of  ranchland, has warned the nutrition panel to back off. In a hearing  last year, he declared that the panel had drifted to a place beyond  its \"understanding and could affect regulations it is not even  qualified to assess.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In December's lame-duck session, Congress inserted language in a  massive budget package which demanded that the food pyramid deal  with nutrition and only nutrition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration is now mulling whether to move forward in an  effort to rework the pyramid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"When we think about the ways to reduce our environmental impact,  diets don't typically come up,\" said Emily Cassidy, a research  analyst at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy  organization. \"But they play a major role... This is something  Americans want to know more about.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>evan.halper@tribpub.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Evan Halper, Tribune Washington Bureau</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo / graphic: Advocates of a food pyramid that takes into account climate  change claim cattle are the least planet-friendly food source.

It comes from burning oil, gas and coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere broke a record in May, continuing its relentless climb, scientists said Friday. It is now 50 percent higher than the preindustrial average, before humans began the widespread burning of oil, gas and coal in the late 19th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at anytime in at least 4 million years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concentration of the gas reached nearly 421 parts per million in May, the peak for the year, as power plants, vehicles, farms and other sources around the world continued to pump huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Emissions totaled 36.3 billion tons in 2021, the highest level in history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the planet keeps warming, with effects like increased flooding, more extreme heat, drought and worsening wildfires that are already being experienced by millions of people worldwide. Average global temperatures are now about 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, higher than in preindustrial times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Growing carbon dioxide levels are more evidence that countries have made little progress toward the goal set in Paris in 2015 of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s the threshold beyond which scientists say the likelihood of catastrophic effects of climate change increases significantly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are \u201ca stark reminder that we need to take urgent, serious steps to become a more climate-ready nation,\u201d Rick Spinrad, the NOAA administrator, said in a statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although carbon dioxide levels dipped somewhat around 2020 during the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there was no effect on the long-term trend, Pieter Tans, a senior scientist with NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory, said in an interview.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rate of increase in carbon dioxide concentration \u201cjust kept on going,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it keeps on going for about the same pace as it did for the past decade.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carbon dioxide levels vary throughout the year, increasing as vegetation dies and decays in the fall and winter, and decreasing in spring and summer as growing plants absorb the gas through photosynthesis. The peak is reached every May, just before plant growth accelerates in the Northern Hemisphere. (The North has a larger effect than the Southern Hemisphere because there is much more land surface and vegetation in the North.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Tans and others at the laboratory calculated the peak concentration this year at 420.99 parts per million, based on data from a NOAA weather station atop the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. Observations began there in the late 1950s by a Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist, Charles David Keeling, and the long-term record is known as the Keeling Curve.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scripps\u2019 scientists still make observations at Mauna Loa under a program run by Dr. Keeling\u2019s son, Ralph Keeling. Using that independent data, which is similar to NOAA\u2019s, they calculated the concentration at 420.78.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both figures are about 2 parts per million higher than last year\u2019s record. This peak is 140 parts per million above the average concentration in preindustrial days, which was consistently about 280 parts per million. Since that time, humans have pumped about 1.6 trillion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To reach the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, emissions must reach \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050, meaning sharp cuts, with any remaining emissions balanced out by absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans and vegetation. If the world approached that target, the rate of increase in carbon dioxide levels would slow down and the Keeling Curve would flatten out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If emissions were completely eliminated, Dr. Tans said, the Keeling Curve would start to fall, as the oceans and vegetation continued to absorb the existing carbon dioxide from the air. The decline in atmospheric concentration would continue for hundreds of years, although progressively more slowly, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At some point an equilibrium would be reached, he said, but carbon dioxide concentrations in both the atmosphere and oceans would be higher than preindustrial levels and would remain that way for thousands of years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over such a long time scale, sea levels could rise significantly as polar ice melts and other changes could take place, like the conversion of Arctic tundra to forests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s that long tail that is really worrisome to me,\u201d Dr. Tans said. \u201cThat has the potential to really change climate.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

But it has contributed to increased emissions and a loss of Europe\u2019s protected woodlands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>European lawmakers voted this week to phase out some wood-energy subsidies, a recognition that more than a decade of government incentives has contributed to deforestation without curbing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Wednesday\u2019s vote in the European Parliament leaves key details unsettled and no changes will take place for at least a year. Governments are under tremendous pressure to ease soaring energy prices this winter as Russia cuts its gas supply to Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>European governments began subsidizing wood energy more than a decade ago as a way to encourage power plants and homeowners to move away from oil and natural gas. A booming market for wood pellets sprung up. Wood is now Europe\u2019s largest renewable energy source, far ahead of wind and solar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The vote shows how dramatically political opinions of wood have shifted since last year, when government figures revealed that burning wood in the European Union released more carbon dioxide than would have been emitted had that energy come from fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe writing is on the wall: Cutting down forests for energy use is neither sustainable, nor does it help with our energy independence,\u201d said Tiemo Woelken, a German member of the European Parliament who supported ending the subsidies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than half of the wood harvested in Europe is burned for heat or electricity. This energy helps countries reach their renewable energy targets, since wood is renewable because trees ultimately grow back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New York Times showed last week that loggers are clearcutting areas in protected forests and grinding them into sawdust to make pellets for burning. These pellets are marketed as green, but by some measures, burning them releases more carbon than burning coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, governments have offered billions of dollars in tax break and financial incentives for wood pellet buyers and producers alike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Money that encourages logging entire trees for energy will likely be unlawful in 2024. Wood energy from sawdust waste, trees logged for fire prevention and naturally fallen trees would still be eligible for subsidies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And governments could still count wood power toward their clean energy goals, a provision that was welcomed by the trade group Bioenergy Europe, whose membership includes pellet manufacturers. But Maija Lepisto, the group\u2019s spokeswoman, wrote in an email that it was counterproductive to weaken domestic power sources in the midst of an energy crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cLimiting the use of a renewable source like bioenergy contradicts the climate ambitions of the European Union and affects the entire supply chain,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mary S. Booth, an ecologist and director of the Partnership for Policy Integrity, said the bill passed in Parliament was too vague and difficult to enforce. She called for clear deadlines and targets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The details remain murky and must still be worked out in discussions among national governments, a process that is expected to begin later this year or early next year. So lobbying on the issue will continue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t see any easy solutions to those problems, especially if you take into account that we are going to have a substantial shortage of energy in Europe,\u201d said Nils Torvalds, a member of the European Parliament from Finland.

The concentration of all that pollution is toxic. Nearby communities, including Wilmington and San Pedro, have the region's highest cancer risk from air pollution, according to air quality regulators, and higher rates of asthma than the rest of the state. Communities along the highways used by the trucks have been dubbed \"diesel death zones.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2017, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia pledged to transform the port complex into a zero-emissions facility by 2035. It's an ambitious and expensive effort -- $14 billion by one estimate -- but absolutely essential. Now the mayors are facing the first test of their commitment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plan called for a fee on shipping containers both to raise money to help truckers buy cleaner vehicles and to incentivize them to switch sooner. The fee would be paid by cargo owners -- including retailers, manufacturers and farmers -- who would get a rebate if they hired cleaner trucks to transport their goods. But port officials have proposed pretty much the lowest fee possible, and that's a serious problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the proposal being considered Monday, the ports would charge $20 per loaded 40-foot container, which is the standard size container these days. That would be no more than 1% of the cost to ship a container through the ports. The fee would generate about $90 million a year, which sounds like a lot of money, but it would help only around 900 of the more than 18,000 trucks serving the ports make the switch from diesel to cleaner natural gas each year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An economic analysis found the ports could charge between $10 and $140 per container with minimal effect on their business. Above $140 per container, the companies that export and import goods would start shifting their cargo to other ports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposed $20-per-container fee is also much less than the $70 fee charged on the oldest, dirtiest trucks a decade ago during the first effort to clean up port pollution. That program was controversial, but it slashed pollution from harbor trucks by more than 90% nearly three years ahead of schedule. Emissions remain far too great, hence the need for another round.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this time is different, port officials argue. President Trump's misguided trade war has already whittled cargo volumes and shifted manufacturing away from China toward other countries that can use ports on the East Coast or in the Gulf of Mexico. Those ports have expanded and gained some of L.A. and Long Beach's business. The prospect of a recession hangs over the economy. And now the coronavirus has dramatically slowed global trade, and who knows how long that will last.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So port officials are understandably cautious about imposing a new fee. They worry it will hurt port business, which will hurt the regional economy. Roughly 1 in 9 jobs in Southern California are tied to international trade through the ports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a low fee has its own shortcomings. At $20 a container, it could take more than 20 years to raise the money needed to convert all the dirty trucks. That doesn't send a strong market signal to manufacturers to speed up development of near-zero and zero-emission trucks. Nor is the fee high enough to incentivize companies to switch to cleaner rigs to avoid paying the charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, Southern California is facing a 2023 deadline to dramatically cut emissions to meet Clean Air Act standards or else face potentially hefty federal penalties, and it won't pass that test without cleaning up trucks that use the ports. Air regulators have proposed a regional sales tax hike to pay for clean vehicles, but that would let the logistics industry shift the cost of cleaning up its dirty ways onto area residents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A container fee, on the other hand, would keep that cost where it belongs, on cargo owners and their customers. Shoppers can surely afford to pay a couple of extra pennies for their Nikes, their televisions and other imported goods to help clean up diesel death zones and fight climate change.</p></div>", "n_sources": 12}

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration has moved aggressively to roll back environmental protections and speed up oil and coal projects, it has repeatedly been blocked by courts finding that the administration did not follow longstanding rules in making its sweeping changes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, a federal judge has issued a repudiation of one of President Trump\u2019s first acts as president, his decision to allow the disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline to proceed, saying that the administration failed to present a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for the move and \u201csimply discarded\u201d the effect the project would have on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decision could thrust the White House into a contentious new legal battle over climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The judge\u2019s finding quickly drew fire from Mr. Trump, who has elevated the pipeline as a prominent symbol of his administration\u2019s effort to encourage fossil fuel use. \u201cIt was a political decision made by a judge,\u201d said Mr. Trump on Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ruling, by Judge Brian Morris of United States District Court for Montana, blocked construction on the 1,179-mile pipeline, which would carry 800,000 barrels a day of petroleum from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast and has, over the past decade, become a lighting rod in broader political battles over energy, the environment and climate change. While experts have long said that the substantive impact of the pipeline on jobs, climate change and the nation\u2019s energy economy is small, it has nonetheless taken on an outsize prominence in the national discussion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Morris\u2019 decision echoes a common theme in many judicial rejections of Trump administration policies, particularly on environmental issues. In short, the court said, the administration failed to follow established rules and procedures for decisions like these. Specifically, it failed to provide a fact-based analysis justifying its actions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Morris, an Obama appointee, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the president\u2019s remarks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis has been typical of the Trump administration,\u201d said Mark Squillace, an expert on environmental law at the University of Colorado Law School. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job dealing with the factual findings of the previous administration. The courts have been clear that you can change your position, even if it\u2019s for a political reason. But you have to show your work, how you got from Point A to Point B.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decision leaves plenty of room for the Trump administration or TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, to appeal. Analysts said that if it did so armed with a deeply researched analysis arguing its position, it could well reverse the finding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s feasible, if they do the work, and show their work, and they explain, with serious, fact-based analysis, why they\u2019re choosing a different outcome, that the courts would uphold it,\u201d Mr. Squillace said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Barack Obama rejected the Keystone permit in 2015, he was weeks away from negotiating an international global warming accord in Paris, and he sought to use the move as a symbol of his global leadership on climate change. He argued the pipeline would undercut United States leadership in curbing global reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two days after Mr. Trump took office, though, he made Keystone a symbol of the post-Obama era of climate policy and energy, signing an executive order overturning Mr. Obama\u2019s rejection of the pipeline. That move signaled that Mr. Trump would be moving forward with an aggressive effort to more substantively dismantle Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change legacy \u2014 including withdrawing the United States from the Paris accord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In saying that no work can go forward until the government more fully reviews the pipeline\u2019s environmental impact, the ruling further stokes the political battles over climate change by a president who dismisses mainstream science and whose administration is also seeking to block a landmark lawsuit on behalf of children asking the government to stop the rise of planet-warming gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Construction on many portions of the pipeline has already been completed. At issue is the final phase, a leg that would run from Steele City, Neb., through Montana to Canada.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, environmental groups hailed the move as a victory in the battle over Keystone, which has spanned more than a decade. \u201cKeystone XL would be a disaster for the climate and for the people and wildlife of this country,\u201d Jackie Prange, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil industry characterized the move as the latest turn of the screw in the long-running legal battle. \u201cPipelines like KXL are the backbone of our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure and one of the most environmentally sound ways to transport the fuel and petroleum products that power America,\u201d said Robin Rorick, vice president of midstream operations for the American Petroleum Industry, which lobbies for oil companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe pipeline has passed every environmental review conducted for it. In fact, a total of six assessments by both the Obama and Trump administrations concluded that KXL is safe to build,\u201d Mr. Rorick said. \u201cCalls to conduct identical environmental reviews makes no sense and are a waste of tax dollars.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TransCanada did not respond to a request for comment. Construction could have begun as early as next year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Morris found that in reviving Keystone, the Trump administration did not adequately account for how a decline in oil prices might affect the pipeline\u2019s viability. In addition, the government\u2019s analysis did not fully study the potential for oil spills or the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions from the Keystone pipeline in combination with a pipeline approved in 2009, the Alberta Clipper.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ruling specifically takes the Trump administration to task for failing to address the Obama administration\u2019s arguments about climate change, including the need to keep rising global temperatures at safe levels as a basis for denying the pipeline permit. Rather, the government declared it was embracing a policy shift toward \u201cenergy security, economic development and infrastructure.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The judge said an administration had the right to reverse a previous policy, but still must back up its reason for doing so with facts. \u201cThe Department instead simply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change to support its course reversal,\u201d the judge wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He cited a United States Supreme Court ruling that noted, \u201cAn agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank slate.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Energy and policy analysts say that the pitched battle over Keystone is out of scale to the project\u2019s actual significance as an environmental threat or an engine of the economy. The pipeline will have relatively little effect, they say, on climate change, oil production in the Canadian oil sands, gasoline prices or the overall job market in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cKeystone is not a very large issue in the context of energy or climate change policy for the U.S.,\u201d said Robert Stavins, the head of the environmental economics department at Harvard University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He noted that, by comparison, Mr. Trump\u2019s moves to roll back Environmental Protection Agency rules on carbon dioxide pollution from tailpipes and power plants, and his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change accord, will have a profound impact on the emission of gases that warm the planet when they enter the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Construction of the pipeline would also be insignificant in terms of advancing Mr. Trump\u2019s professed goal of achieving \u201cenergy dominance\u201d for the United States, said Mr. Stavins, saying that its purpose is to help move oil produced in Canada to Gulf Coast ports where it can be exported to the global market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis published by the State Department during the Obama administration estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs for two years \u2014 about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest through indirect support, like food service \u2014 but only 35 permanent jobs. Similarly, the government concluded that the increase in carbon dioxide pollution associated with burning the oil transported through the pipeline would amount to less than 1 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Human activity was changing the Earth's drought and rainfall patterns as far back as the early 20th century, new research shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drying in many regions, the researchers suggested, will get worse, with sobering implications for feeding the planet\u2019s billions of people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new paper tracks long-term patterns of moisture levels in soil across regions of the world, including North America, Central America, Eurasia and the Mediterranean. The researchers found a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of human effects from producing greenhouse gases, as distinct from natural variability, as far back as 1900.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists have long known that the planet has shown an overall pattern of warmer temperatures since that time \u2014 the phenomenon is the subject of a famous cartoon by Randall Munroe \u2014 but the new research shows the effects of that warming correlate with drier soil in some parts of the world and wetter soil in others. Climate scientists have long suggested that in a warming world, dry parts of the planet will become drier and wet parts of the planet will become wetter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t a new thing,\u201d said Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University, and lead author of the report, but the new research ties human activity that causes climate change to the drought record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the researchers combined computer models with archives of tree rings, which \u201cgive us a record of global drought going back centuries,\u201d Dr. Marvel said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She stressed, however, that \u201cwe\u2019re not saying we\u2019re seeing a large effect\u201d in the historical record. Instead, the research teases out the effect of human activity from the natural background variability of weather and climate, \u201ca background note against a symphony of other sounds.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result, said Benjamin Cook, a co-author of the study who is at the Goddard Institute and Columbia University, is that \u201cwe\u2019re beginning to understand the fundamental processes and the basic impact of climate change on drought.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scientists found the results fell into three broad phases between 1900 and the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A warming period in the first half of the 20th century showed a significant signal of human-caused climate change. From 1950 until 1975, however, there was a midcentury decrease in drought and a muddying of the signal that the scientists suggest was caused by aerosol emissions of pollutants like oxides of sulfur that contribute to smog, and could block some of the sun\u2019s light from reaching Earth and affect weather patterns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After that, the signal of human-caused climate change picked up again in the 1980s, potentially because of restrictions on pollution in the United States and agreements to reduce aerosol emissions around the world. The fingerprint has become even more obvious since 2000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The period of relative cooling and diminished human climate signal suggests more study is needed, Dr. Cook said, but he noted that one of the proposals for fighting the effects of climate change involves spraying aerosols containing sulfates into the upper atmosphere, a process similar to what occurred during the middle period of the study. \u201cIt was kind of an accidental geoengineering experiment in the middle of the 20th century,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way that the researchers detected the climate signal was by looking around the globe. They found that three regions \u2014 Australia, Mexico and the Mediterranean \u2014 were drying at the same time, even though they react differently to large phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cThis means that it is harder for natural climate variability alone to produce, by chance, the simultaneous drying across all three regions identified in the fingerprint,\u201d the authors wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the effects of climate change grow, what happens next, the paper stated, will be dire, particularly since many of the areas headed into lasting drought are agricultural centers today: \u201cThe human consequences of this, particularly drying over large parts of North America and Eurasia, will likely be severe.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Abigail Swann, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the research, said, \u201cIt shows a creative way to leverage information especially from the earlier part of the century to figure out what was the cause of droughts in the past.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, praised the paper in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWhile the big message of climate change has not changed, we are now making huge progress in understanding what climate change actually means for societies in terms of how global warming affects local variables that are ultimately relevant for food security,\u201d she wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The underlying message, Dr. Otto said, is that \u201cclimate change is really here and happening now and not something we can afford (in all meanings of that term) to continue to ignore.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The Trump administration's position, at least initially, threatened a standoff in which the United States would not sign onto a statement that included climate discussion and other members would not agree to a version that left it out, according to senior diplomats and others familiar with the discussions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration objected to language that, while nonbinding, could be read as a collective commitment to address the effects of climate change in the Arctic, diplomats said. One official familiar with the preparations for this year's meeting said that at meetings last month, the United States \"indicated its resistance to any mention of climate change whatsoever.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three officials from member states, who described the negotiations on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions, said the U.S. position appears to have softened in recent days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There have been challenges in the negotiations with the United States,\" one of these officials said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All three said the United States initially wanted no reference to climate change or the Paris international climate agreement in the joint statement to be issued in Finland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"At one point, they wanted to remove the expression 'climate change' and blocked references of the Paris agreement and other international agreements in the language. But the dialogue has improved during the last couple of days,\" the senior official said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tension over the Arctic statement is the latest example of the Trump administration's willingness to break with allies and much of the world in its approach to climate issues. The president continues to express skepticism about the causes and severity of climate change, despite the scientific consensus on the issue, while portraying efforts to address it as foolhardy and a threat to the economy. Democrats have hammered the White House on the issue, with House Democrats approving legislation Thursday that would bar the Trump administration from pulling out of the Paris global agreement on reducing carbon emissions that was approved in 2015.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change has become a central issue for the Arctic Council as warming in the Arctic has accelerated. Scientists say the Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet, with implications for sea levels, weather patterns and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pompeo will travel to northern Finland for the two-day session next week with fellow foreign ministers from Nordic nations, Canada and Russia. The meeting is the first high-level gathering of the Arctic Council since the United States announced in June 2017 that it would withdraw from the Paris agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department officially oversees U.S. participation in the council \u2014 which was formed in 1996 to address issues unique to the region, with the exception of how each country uses its military in the Arctic. Its work typically draws little notice in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House, which in February devised a plan to challenge the scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels is the leading cause of climate change and poses growing economic and health threats, has largely assumed control of U.S. preparations for the meeting, officials and former officials said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department did not respond directly to questions from The Washington Post about the U.S. position. Later, during a briefing with reporters previewing the trip, a senior State Department official declined to address whether the United States had taken such a hard line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Obviously, we don't discuss details of ongoing negotiations,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under State Department rules. \"When we don't agree with allies and friends, we talk about it with them directly and closely.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official said the United States is a leader in research into the changes occurring in the Arctic and has worked to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and black carbon output.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's not an issue we shy away from,\" the official said. \"We're very proud of our record.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official also lauded the council as a good forum to address the complex global challenge of protecting the environment while supporting economic growth. The official pledged the United States would work with fellow members of the council \"on how to express it and what action we will take to address it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Finland, Pompeo will give a speech on U.S. policy in the Arctic that is expected to address U.S. concerns about Chinese and other foreign activities in the region. Some of the energy exploration and maritime expansion in the Arctic is possible only because of changes in the climate that have taken place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Negotiations on the council statement continued this week, one official said. He predicted the final document will include something \"substantive\" and \"robust\" on the impact of climate change in the Arctic, although he was not sure whether the phrase 'climate change' itself would be used.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two officials said they do not expect the document to refer to the Paris agreement now that the United States is pulling out \u2014 an apparent compromise. The other seven Arctic nations are signatories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aleksi H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen, a former Finnish ambassador who chairs the group of diplomats from each nation who serve as delegates to the council, said negotiations are still not completed over wording in the final, joint declaration that must be approved unanimously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen declined to be specific, but said the remaining differences reflect \"different shades of gray.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have made good progress,\" H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen said in a phone interview. \"There is a willingness on all sides to achieve a result, to be able to get a declaration all can agree on. I sense the willingness to make compromises. I believe this will be the outcome. But we are not there yet.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration, particularly Secretary of State John F. Kerry, saw the Arctic Council \u2014 which includes the United States, Canada, Russia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland \u2014 as a vehicle for talking about climate change because of the dramatic pace of events in the region.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump administration has taken the opposite view and is reluctant to highlight the dire situation in the Arctic, said David Balton, a former State Department official who was in charge of Arctic policy through 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's not so much facts are in dispute, as it is what the Arctic Council in particular ought to be doing about it, and how the document ought to characterize Paris,\" he said. \"It's more about public relations, that the administration should not sign a document that calls for the council, including the United States, to broadcast to the world just how terrible the situation for climate in the Arctic really is.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Representatives of indigenous Arctic people also participate in council discussions, although they do not vote. They all support making a strong statement on climate change, and at the last biannual meeting, in Alaska, native representatives told then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that their livelihoods and culture are at stake.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The council and its agenda are more important for other members, most of which have a national identity intertwined with the region and consider the body the preeminent forum for addressing Arctic issues. The United States is a member because of Alaska.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m addressed the council's mission during meetings with Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton in Washington this week. A brief State Department summary of the Pompeo meeting did not mention climate change, nor did a tweet from Bolton that called his session productive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Sweden remains steadfast in our work to curb the impact of climate change and its effect on the Arctic, one of the most sensitive areas to climate change,\" she said in a statement to The  Post afterward. \"The Arctic Council's work on this issue is crucial and will be discussed during their next meeting.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pompeo says little about climate change in his role as Trump's top diplomat, although he said during his confirmation hearing last year that he agrees that it is happening. Last month, Pompeo said the Paris accord \"didn't change a thing\" for the better.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Go look at the countries that are still in the Paris agreement and see what their CO2 emissions were. It's one thing to sign a document; it's another thing to actually change your behavior,\" Pompeo said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a  congressman from Kansas, he made equivocal statements about the validity of scientific assessments of climate change, and called the Obama administration climate agenda \"radical.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pompeo will also visit Greenland on his European trip next week, where he could see dramatic effects of climate change up close.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greenland, a sparsely populated island that lies mostly above the Arctic Circle, has lost ice at an accelerating pace in the past several decades. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimates that Greenland's glaciers went from dumping about 51 billion tons of ice into the ocean between 1980 and 1990, to 286\u00a0billion tons between 2010 and 2018.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The rapid unraveling of the Arctic continues to transform the global climate system, causing sea level to rise, permafrost to thaw and sea ice and the planet's reflectivity to disappear,\" said Rafe Pomerance, chair of the conservation advocacy network Arctic 21 and a senior fellow at Woods Hole Research Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It is the central issue for the Arctic Council to address. The joint statement of ministers of the Arctic Council must reflect the urgency of Arctic decline and the commitment of governments to act with absolute urgency to respond,\" Pomerance said. \"The fate of Greenland is the fate of Miami.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last Arctic Council ministers' meeting was held in May 2017, in Fairbanks, Alaska, less than four months into the new administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tillerson asked for small changes in the text of the 2017 statement, which called climate change a pressing issue in the Arctic and took note of the Paris agreement without endorsing it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The joint declaration stressed \"the need for global action to reduce both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three weeks later, Trump announced that the United States would pull out of the Paris agreement.

The broad appeal of nuclear fusion to researchers , as well as investors and companies, stems from its potential as a clean-energy alternative to sources that involve the burning of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though researchers say the commercial application of nuclear fusion likely remains years and perhaps decades away, the technology might one day help fight climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's what to know about nuclear-fusion energy and the recent breakthrough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is nuclear-fusion energy? Is it different from fission?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fusion is the process by which two atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier one . Current nuclear-power plants create energy through fission, or splitting heavy atoms apart.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Lawrence Livermore lab's National Ignition Facility, scientists use lasers to help superheat and compress tiny pellets containing hydrogen atoms. The extreme conditions create a state of matter known as plasma, in which hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium and release a tremendous amount of energy during the process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can it provide limitless, clean energy?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fuel needed for fusion is abundant; many of these hydrogen atoms can be extracted from seawater. Fusion, unlike fission, also doesn't produce long-lived radioactive waste, or greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide generated by fossil-fuel burning. The only byproduct of a fusion reaction is helium, an inert gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was accomplished by researchers at the National Ignition Facility?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists there announced that a Dec. 5 experiment produced more energy than it consumed in a controlled nuclear-fusion reaction. This is known as ignition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the facility began operations in 2009, the goal of a fusion reaction that produces an energy gain\u2014a critical step toward transforming fusion into a practical source of energy\u2014had eluded researchers. The recent experiment produced 3.15 megajoules of fusion energy, compared with 2.05 megajoules of energy used to trigger the reaction, resulting in a net energy gain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What are the benefits of fusion energy?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fusing atoms together in a controlled way releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal or gas, according to the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There would also be no risk of a runaway nuclear meltdown in a fusion reactor\u2014as is possible at a nuclear-fission plant\u2014because fusion energy production isn't based on a chain reaction. If any disturbance occurs during a fusion reaction, the plasma cools and the process stops. Fusion reactions can also produce four times as much energy as nuclear fission reactions, according to the agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When will fusion energy become widely available?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the Energy Department recently made a $50 million investment for public-private partnerships to start working toward fusion pilot-plant designs, the commercialization of fusion energy is years, if not decades away, according to researchers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many people like the analogy with flight, so this would be the Wright's flyer lifting off the ground for the first time,\" said Jonathan Davies, a senior scientist at the University of Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics. \"Commercial fusion energy would then be flying passenger jets around the world on a regular basis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Technical issues first will need to be solved, according to Gianluca Sarri, a professor of physics at Queen's University Belfast who wasn't involved in the new milestone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the issues include the inefficient nature of the lasers that scientists at the Livermore lab use to trigger fusion reactions. The lasers are less than 1% efficient, according to Dr. Davies. The National Ignition Facility used hundreds of megajoules of electricity to produce the laser light needed to produce about 3 megajoules of fusion energy in the recent experiment. A few megajoules are enough to heat only around 10 kettles of water.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A laser fusion power plant would have to fire something like 10 times per second to give a reasonable electrical power output,\" Dr. Davies said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why is fusion so difficult to achieve?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bringing together the nuclei of multiple hydrogen atoms isn't easy to do\u2014each nucleus has a positive charge, so a natural force repels the two atoms, preventing them from fusing. Extreme temperatures and pressures are needed to overcome that electrical repulsion and enable the nuclei to get close enough to each other\u2014and for long enough\u2014to fuse. Our sun and other stars are powered by this process; the celestial bodies' massive gravitational forces and very high temperatures create the conditions for fusion to occur.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Replicating those extreme conditions in a laboratory on Earth is challenging. The Livermore lab's lasers help heat hydrogen atoms to temperatures of more than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit and pressures more than 100 billion times Earth's atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This experiment has demonstrated for the first time this can be done in a laboratory setting, rather than in a star,\" said Dr. Robbie Scott, a senior plasma physicist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's Central Laser Facility near Oxford, England, who wasn't involved in the recent experiment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers in more than 50 countries are working on nuclear fusion and plasma physics research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could fusion energy be used?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Atomic Energy Agency has said fusion could be used to generate electricity commercially. But there are other potential applications that could be developed such as hydrogen production, water desalination, direct air capture of carbon dioxide, and electrofuel production, according to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Aylin Woodward at aylin.woodward@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nuclear Fusion Energy: What to Know About the Latest Scientific Breakthrough</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Aylin Woodward\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Of those respondents, 44 percent\u00a0attributed the colder weather to climate change. Nearly 4 in 10, 37 percent,\u00a0thought the same in 2015, and 29 percent did so\u00a0in 2014.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, 70 percent of those\u00a0Americans who reported higher-than-usual temperatures this year blamed those\u00a0usually mild conditions on climate change. That's up significantly from 2012, when\u00a038 percent of such respondents\u00a0saw global warming as responsible for the balmier conditions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, people's prior beliefs about climate change seem to\u00a0color their perceptions of how weird was the winter weather.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Those who worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming are more likely to report experiencing warmer than usual winter weather than those worried only a little or not at all,\" Saad said. \"The finding is similar for the perception that winter is colder than usual.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And human beings in general are much less reliable measurers of temperature than a regular-old mercury thermometer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Gallup, Americans were more likely to say they went through a colder-than-average winter rather than a warmer-than-average one. But the reality is that the United States had\u00a0above-average temperatures between December 2018 and February 2019, according to the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That discrepancy may be due to\u00a0the timing of survey.\u00a0It was conducted during the first 10\u00a0days of March, immediately\u00a0after a February that clocked in\u00a01.8 degrees below average.\u00a0The\u00a0Midwest was in the middle of that\u00a0\"polar vortex\" freeze at the start of the month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"February seems to be what people have in mind when they answer in March,\" Saad\u00a0said. She added that parts of December were\u00a0so warm near her home in Connecticut that she sent her kids to school in shorts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gallup's results are part of its\u00a0annual report on Americans' attitudes about climate change, which will be released in full next week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet President Trump is pointing to the low thermometer reading as a sign that man-made climate change is not happening. In January, for example, he tweeted: \"In the beautiful Midwest, wind chill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can't last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, as counterintuitive as it may sound, there is heated debate among climate scientists over whether those\u00a0extreme cold\u00a0snaps\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as\u00a0the one that rolled through the United States in January \u2014\u00a0are due to rising temperatures in the Arctic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea is that the lack of sea ice up north\u00a0destabilizes the jet stream that encircles\u00a0the Arctic, causing the river of air to dip farther to the south and deliver a punch of cold polar wind to low latitudes. As more Americans hear about that theory, still not fully accepted by all climate scientists, more may be associating the cold snaps with climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other recent polling\u00a0show Americans\u00a0increasingly noticing\u00a0what they think are\u00a0the effects of climate change around them\u00a0following recent torrential hurricanes and massive wildfires \u2014\u00a0weather events scientists know with more certainty are made worse by warming temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a University of Chicago survey, for example, of the respondents that\u00a0said they found the climate science more convincing \u00a0than they did five years ago, three-quarters of them\u00a0acknowledged that\u00a0recent hurricanes, floods, droughts and unusual heat influenced their views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That effect can even be felt in GOP-leaning North Carolina. After two major hurricanes in the past three years brought devastating floods to the state,\u00a0an Elon University poll last year found that 37 percent of Republicans there\u00a0believe global warming is \"very likely\" to hurt\u00a0North Carolina's\u00a0coastal communities over the next half-century\u00a0\u2014\u00a0nearly triple the number of Republicans who said the same in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I always thought climate change was a bunch of nonsense,\" one Trump-supporting North Carolinian told The Post's Tracy Jan last year. \"But now I really do think it is happening.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Trump's EPA chief defines \"the biggest environmental threat we have\": And it's not climate\u00a0change. Recently\u00a0confirmed Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0Administrator Andrew Wheeler told CBS News that\u00a0\"drinking water today worldwide is probably the biggest environmental threat we have\" and is \"a crisis that I think we can solve.\"\u00a0He told the network the climate change is \"an important change we have to be addressing and we are addressing,\" but said \"most of the threats from climate change are 50-75 years out.\" \"What we need to do is make sure that the people who are dying today from the lack of having drinking water in third world countries \u2013 that problem is addressed,\" he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 What Trump's budget does to science: More details have been made public about how Trump's budget request could impact the National Science Foundation, the agency that provides a quarter of all federal funding for basic research, The Post's Ben Guarino reports. The 12 percent reduction would mean 1,000 fewer grants in 2020, and 400 fewer graduate students than its fellowship program funded last year. The budget proposal would cut research funding in 2020 for the biological sciences, computer sciences, engineering and social sciences by a tenth compared with 2019 levels. Geosciences, mathematical and physical sciences funding would be cut by 15 percent, and polar programs by almost 20 percent. But there are some proposed increases, such as for artificial intelligence research as well as for funding for advanced manufacturing, semiconductors and microelectronics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some GOP lawmakers have pushed back on proposed energy and environmental cuts: \"[White House officials] make some proposals in there that they know we're not going to go along with,\" said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), the ranking Republican of the House Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development, according to Bloomberg Environment. \"Elections have consequences, and the bills we write are going to be more in the Democratic mold,\" he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 FERC nominee\u00a0derailed:\u00a0Energy Secretary Rick Perry and major coal companies worked to convince the president not to nominate a prominent lawyer for a spot on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because he had been publicly critical of the administration's proposal to help struggling coal power plants. David Hill, who served as general counsel for the Energy Department in the George W. Bush administration was a likely candidate for the post, Politico\u00a0reported, but he said his nomination process has ended. \"He had been expected to fill the vacancy created by former FERC Chairman Kevin McIntyre's death in January,\" according to Politico. \"But the parallel efforts by Perry and the coal industry proved to be more persuasive\u00a0with Trump than his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who was lobbying for Hill.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Oregon lawmakers pass fracking ban: The state's House of Representatives voted 42 to 12 to pass a 10-year ban on the process in the state, a measure that will now head to the state Senate for consideration. While there's no existing fracking operations in the state, \"developers say there's potential for coalbed methane extraction in the Willamette Valley, which this bill would also block,\" the Associated Press reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Much of the Midwest has been ravaged by floodwaters: The massive late-winter storm that battered much of the Midwest has left widespread destruction in the region and has killed at least four people. Vice President Pence, who visited Nebraska to survey the storm-ravaged region,\u00a0vowed presidential disaster declarations would be expedited to help impacted states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, some areas are preparing for more impending destruction. \"While floodwaters remain steady in some areas and recede in others, some regions are bracing for 'major to historic and catastrophic' flooding to come as rivers vault toward their crests this week, fed by rapid snowmelt throughout the Missouri and Mississippi River basins, the National Weather Service said,\" The Post's Alex Horton reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The flooding is hitting Nebraska's\u00a0farms particularly hard: Early estimates show ranching losses in Nebraska will hit $500 million and row-crop losses at another $400 million. \"For livestock, the loss is a combination of animal deaths and loss of productivity (when it's cold, cattle and calves don't grow as fast) as well as loss of quality feed sources,\" The Post's Laura Reiley reports. \"For row crops, [Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson] explained, farmers are very close to planting season, and fear they won't have enough time to clean up the land.\" \"I'm 39 years old; I don't have children. The cows are my children, and my farm is completely destroyed. Maybe it's a sign from God to go and do something else,\" fifth-generation Nebraska rancher Anthony Ruzicka told The Post.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Notorious fish that caught fire now safe to eat: The Environmental Protection Agency gave the green light to ease consumption restrictions on a fish from the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, infamous for catching fire in Cleveland in 1969 because of water pollution. \"This is an example of the progress that can be achieved when you collaborate and dedicate resources to improving the quality of water in our state,\" Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement. \"The Cuyahoga River was already one of the most polluted rivers in the country at the time of the fire on June 22, 1969 .\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0The fire was neither the first nor the worst the river had experienced,\" the Associated Press reports. \"But the 1969 fire on the river, where industrial waste and sewage were regularly dumped, drew national media attention that made it an instant poster child for water pollution at a time when the country was becoming more environmentally aware.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 More river news, Potomac edition:\u00a0The Potomac Riverkeeper Network announced it will start monitoring water quality at six different points along the river to provide public data that and help people decide whether it's safe enough to swim, The Post's Marissa J. Lang\u00a0reports. The information will be uploaded to a website and app, Swim Guide, that tracks weather and water quality at 7,000 beaches worldwide. \"In the District, the Department of Health bars swimming in the river,\" Lang writes. \"It's not outlawed in Virginia or Maryland.

Most of that comes from their belching; livestock manure accounts for an additional 10% of methane emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That puts agriculture on par with the energy industry in methane emissions, with natural gas and petroleum generating 30% and coal mining 10%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some environmentalists say the Biden administration is going easy on big agriculture to avoid a bruising political battle with the powerful farm lobby. Agricultural groups say reducing methane from cattle isn't as simple as plugging leaks from pipelines and oil wells .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oil-and-gas industry groups haven't pressed for methane regulations on agriculture, in part because they don't want to antagonize lawmakers in rural districts, who often represent both energy companies and agribusiness, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mary-Thomas Hart, environmental counsel for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said the group would lobby against Clean Air Act regulations until measuring methane discharges from livestock becomes more precise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said voluntary measures, such as restoration of grazing areas with carbon-absorbing plants, are the best way for the industry to lower carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Regulating farmers and ranchers out of business isn't the answer if you want to continue\" those carbon-reducing farming practices, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists say that despite the challenges, there is an urgent need to curb emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While carbon dioxide is considered the biggest global warming contributor, methane traps roughly 85 times as much heat. Global leaders at the Glasgow climate summit last year made cutting methane emissions a priority, with the U.S. and dozens of other countries pledging to cut emissions by 30% by 2030 .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Biden administration has talked often about the importance of cutting methane and has imposed new methane restrictions on the energy sector, but they're simultaneously giving a free pass to agriculture,\" said Viveca Morris, executive director of the Law, Ethics & Animals Program at Yale Law School.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, led by nonprofit watchdog group Public Justice, petitioned the EPA last year to regulate methane emissions from big dairy and hog farms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The window for taking action is short,\" Sierra Club attorney Andres Restrepo said. \"We have to do everything we can to address these emissions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Methane from manure and digestion has grown 19.3% since 1990, mostly because more farmers are mixing manure with liquid for disposal. Emissions from oil and gas, which face new regulations estimated to cost producers $1.5 billion by 2026, have fallen 17%, according to the EPA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Policy makers in favor of more serious, enforceable regulations could face headwinds from the powerful farm lobby. That consortium of groups has the backing of well-resourced global producers such as Tyson Foods Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Cargill Inc.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agriculture lobby has spent about $704 million in the past five years to influence policy makers on a range of issue including greenhouse-gas emissions, according to statistics compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lobby can also mobilize grass-roots campaigns quickly in nearly every rural Congressional district, where agriculture is often a major employer and economic engine, said Ben Lilliston, director of rural strategies and climate change for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a Minnesota nonprofit that tracks emissions from agribusiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think Biden and the Democrats are reluctant to step up to really change agribusiness and the big agriculture lobby because they are worried about offending them and potentially losing support in rural America,\" Mr. Lilliston said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress isn't weighing any proposals that include regulations on agricultural methane. Some lawmakers support voluntary financial incentives for ranchers and farmers to cut methane emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) said Congress should consider stronger emissions standards as an option for cutting methane. \"But anything we do should consider the voices of family farmers across the country,\" he said in a statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Farmers and agricultural researchers say there are no easy solutions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm optimistic, but I'm also cautioning the farming community not to wait for a silver bullet,\" said Frank Mitloehner, a University of California, Davis researcher who has tested natural ingredients such as garlic as feed additives to reduce methane from cows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>European Union food-safety regulators in November approved the use of the chemical Bovaer, which can cut belched methane from beef cattle by up to 80%. Its Dutch manufacturer, Royal DSM NV, is hoping to win U.S. approval.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another possible solution calls for attaching rubber masks above cow nostrils to neutralize methane emissions. Cargill is preparing to put the devices, from London startup Zelp Ltd., on dairy cows in Europe later this year. Francisco Norris, Zelp's chief executive officer, said the devices aren't widely available yet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For manure, farmers are increasingly putting waste into covered lagoons or silo-like devices called digesters that capture methane that can then be sold as fuel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the systems can cost millions of dollars, and EPA records show fewer than 300 digesters operating on U.S. dairy farms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My question to society is, 'Are you willing to pay for that?' \" said Bryan Sievers, an Iowa farmer with a 2,400-head cattle feedlot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sievers used federal grants to build a $7.3 million digester system, and recently joined with developers on a $14 million expansion and pipeline that will enable him to sell methane to utilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Because of the extremely high cost of these projects, most farms can't do it on their own,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marilyn Hershey built a $3 million digester system for manure at her 800-cow dairy farm outside Philadelphia, using grants and savings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But she still worries that regulators will mandate costly methane rules for farms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The fear is that someone from Washington is going to make a decision even though they've never been on a farm, and that's not right,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say they're counting on market incentives, funding and research, not mandates, to curb cattle methane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're confident we can make a lot of progress over the course of the decade,\" said Bill Hohenstein, the USDA's director of Energy and Environmental Policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Timothy Puko contributed to this article.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Clampdown on U.S. Methane Emissions, Belching Cattle Get a Pass</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Katy Stech Ferek | Photographs and Video by Rachel Wisniewski for The Wall Street Journal\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 11}

Its students and faculty have deployed drones over the Amazon, worked on a \"bionic leaf\" to turn sunlight and water into fuel and fertilizer, and searched for a cheaper \nelectrochemical method of capturing carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's at least one step on climate change that Harvard has not taken: divesting the university's $39 billion endowment of investments in fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past six months, more than 300 Harvard faculty members have signed a petition calling for divestment of fossil fuel stocks. Students, before departing for the summer, held Heat Week to highlight climate change. And leading alumni \u2014 such as former U.S. senator Timothy Wirth of Colorado, former vice president Al Gore and Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund \u2014 have written to Harvard President Lawrence Bacow urging the university to reverse its position.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They have chosen an auspicious moment to make these efforts. Congressional Democrats are weighing the Green New Deal, climate change has popped up in the Democratic presidential debates, and the Senate Finance Committee's ranking Democrat, Ron Wyden of Oregon, and 25 colleagues have introduced a bill to make the tax code climate-sensitive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than 1,070 institutions in more than 30 countries, with total assets of about $8.8\u200atrillion, have divested themselves of fossil fuel shares since a divestment campaign began about nine years ago, according to the website GoFossilFree.org. Some, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, have sold their stakes in all fossil fuel companies. Others, including Georgetown University, have sold off coal and tar sands investments only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With climate change policy lagging in the United States, many are hoping that a push by the nation's academic elites will provide impetus for wider action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, however, only 47 U.S. colleges and universities have chosen to divest and only 10 have taken that step since 2017, according to the environmental activist group 350.org. And the Harvard faculty members who have signed the divestment petition represent less than 14 percent of the faculty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But advocates of divestment have rattled universities across the country. At Yale University, the Environmental Justice Coalition held three sit-ins in the lobby of the Yale Investments Office's building over six months. A group called Go Fossil Free helps students and colleges mount efforts to support divestment of fossil fuel shares. And author Bill McKibben, a Middlebury College professor, leader of 350.org and a Harvard alumnus, has been campaigning for divestment on campuses across the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And divestment campaigners have had some high-profile success. Columbia University in 2017 said it would sell holdings in coal companies. In January, Middlebury said it would phase out of fossil fuel investments, reversing a position taken six years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pension funds have also come under pressure to divest. On June 12, Norway's parliament ordered the country's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund \u2014 built largely from fossil fuels \u2014 to sell its holdings in about 150 oil and gas companies and invest up to $20\u00a0billion, about 2 percent of its total, in renewable energy, mainly wind and solar projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Divestment activists argue that selling shares in fossil fuel companies would be in line with Harvard's ethical standards, send a message to other investors, and rid the endowment of stocks whose prospects are poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the university has not wavered in its opposition to fossil fuel divestment since 2013, when then-Harvard President Drew Faust declared: \"The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said that political investment decisions could \"entail serious risks to the independence of the academic enterprise\" and that the endowment's small stakes would have \"negligible financial impact\" on the companies. And she said that it would be more effective to \"favor engagement over withdrawal.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I love Harvard, but it has a history of reluctance on these things,\" said Gore, who called for divestment in a speech to graduating Harvard students this year. He said the university had also delayed selling shares of companies involved in South Africa when apartheid was still in force and selling shares of tobacco firms because of health concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This one is in that same mold, and eventually they'll have to do it,\" Gore added, \"plain as the nose on your face.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harvard divested itself of nearly a third of its holdings in companies doing business in South Africa in 1986, on the same day the Republican-led Senate approved economic sanctions on South Africa, overriding President Ronald Reagan's veto. This spring, after intense pressure, Harvard disclosed that the university's private investment in companies tied to the prison industry totaled just $18,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think it is both an economic decision and a moral decision,\" Gore said in an interview. He said that the returns on fossil fuel stocks have gone down and that returns on renewable energy stocks have gone up. Moreover, he said, most of the proven coal, oil and gas reserves on the books of fossil fuel companies \"can't be burned and won't be burned,\" regardless of whether the United States is in the Paris climate agreement. He said there would be a \"carbon bubble directly analogous with subprime mortgages,\" which played a key role in the financial crisis of 2008-2009.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caren Solomon, a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, compared divestment of fossil fuel shares to divestment of tobacco shares. In May 1990, Harvard quietly acknowledged that it had sold off tobacco company stocks because their products posed \"a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"From a public health standpoint, climate change is disastrous,\" Solomon said. \"When we burn fossil fuels, we release greenhouse gases and particulate air pollutants. Air pollutants cause heart and lung disease and early death.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Continued global warming \"would have even more devastating effects on health over time, with more heat-related illnesses, more allergies, the greater spread of insect-borne diseases, more waterborne diseases, and more malnutrition because of the effects of carbon dioxide on crops' quality,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet people across the political spectrum still side with Harvard and other institutions resisting pressure to divest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robert D. Reischauer was a senior fellow of the Harvard Corp. and supported then-Harvard President Faust's position against divesting the university's stake in fossil fuels:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have guns, abortion, all sorts of other issues. And movements to stop all investments in countries that aren't acceptable in terms of human rights,\" he said. \"It's a slippery slope.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said that \"Harvard's policy is that they don't want to subject the choice of investment opportunities to petition or popular movement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor who was chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an email: \"I believe the university should remain focused on its central purpose \u2014 the creation and dissemination of knowledge. Once we start using the endowment to address other goals, there become too many candidate industries that some group within the university community will want to divest from, such as guns, tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another issue that could pop up: companies doing business with Israel. \"Divestment was seen as a way of protesting the treatment of the Palestinians,\" Mankiw said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mankiw has been a vigorous supporter of climate action. He favors the imposition of high carbon taxes combined with refunds to households. But regarding divestment, he said: \"I am skeptical of demonizing the fossil fuel industry. Even under an optimal climate policy (which we do not have today), there will be some use to fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But students are impatient.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past, the Harvard Crimson ran editorials saying that divestment would have little impact on big oil companies and that the university would be better off researching ways to get consumers off fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May, however, the Crimson reversed its position, saying that climate change posed \"an existential threat\" and that the university's position \"compromises its efforts to position itself as an academic institution at the forefront of the fight against climate change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The paper said that in the past, it had argued that divestment wasn't practical, wouldn't affect the stock or bond market, wouldn't reverse climate change and would hurt the endowment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"But in an era in which climate change is more rampant, more destructive, and more visible than ever \u2014 not to mention the attacks on its scientific reality \u2014 we realize that we can no longer view an endowment with investments in fossil fuels as an economically sensible future,\" the paper said. And besides the Crimson added, \"symbols matter, and the endowment is a symbol of Harvard's values.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The paper added: \"We have not led this charge. But we now join it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Students care a lot about the climate crisis,\" said Ilana Cohen, a student leader in the Harvard divestment campaign, though it sparked relatively modest turnouts at demonstrations last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Youth has, in a way, the most at stake in the climate crisis,\" Cohen added. \"It's our future, and we are going to bear the burden of what our parents and grandparents have done. There's this kind of imminent need to take action because our futures are really on the line.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steven.mufson@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steven.mufson@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dig Deeper Environment + Economics</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Want to explore the effects of a changing climate on the U.S. economy?

He has set a goal of eliminating fossil fuel emissions from electricity generation by 2035 and has vowed to put the entire United States economy on track to become carbon neutral by midcentury.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former President Trump had announced in 2017 that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, but the exit could not be made official until Nov. 4 last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States was officially out of the agreement for 107 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Mr. Blinken said fighting climate change would be once again at the center of U.S. domestic and foreign policy priorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cClimate change and science diplomacy can never again be \u2018add-ons\u2019 in our foreign policy discussions,\u201d Mr. Blinken said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, he added, \u201cas momentous as our joining the agreement was in 2016 \u2014 and as momentous as our rejoining is today \u2014 what we do in the coming weeks, months, and years is even more important.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the start of the industrial era, the United States has emitted more greenhouse gases than any other country. And so, how the United States uses its money and power has both a symbolic and real bearing on whether the world\u2019s roughly 7.6 billion people, and especially its poorest, will be able to avert climate catastrophes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are two immediate signals to watch for. First, how ambitious will the Biden administration be in its emissions reductions targets? It is under pressure from advocacy groups to reduce emissions by 50 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And second, how much money will the United States provide to help poor countries adapt to the calamities of global warming and shift their economies away from fossil fuels?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answers to both are expected in the next few weeks, in time for the April 22 virtual climate summit that President Biden has said he will host.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

The next year, PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection as it faced an estimated $30 billion in liability after company power lines ignited some of the most destructive fires in California history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least PG&E disclosed its perceived risks, however off target. Not every company tells its investors about the climate-related risks it faces. This is a shortcoming in government efforts to protect Main Street investors as the planet continues to heat up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For investment managers like me, who oversees New York City\u2019s pension funds, understanding those exposures is essential to mitigating risk across our portfolio to secure strong returns for the city\u2019s public-sector workers. Yet under the current regulatory framework, investors are largely in the dark about those perils.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the leadership of its chairman, Gary Gensler, is considering a strong proposal for mandatory climate-risk disclosures by publicly traded companies. Although the agency has argued in the past that some of this information should be acknowledged under existing regulations, this rule would give investors standardized information to evaluate the financial risks of potential liability; damage from rising seas, higher temperatures and other climate consequences; shifts in public policy; and climate-related market shifts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is an important step. The United States is following Britain, France, Japan, Brazil, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand and other countries in moving to mandate climate-risk disclosures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, damage from extreme weather events that each cost at least $1 billion, including wildfires, floods and hurricanes, resulted in $148 billion in damage in the United States alone. A 2019 report by CDP, a nonprofit that measures climate risks, found that those dangers could cost 215 of the world\u2019s leading companies as much as $1 trillion in combined losses, much of it over the next five years. In recent years, climate change has been identified as the area of highest risk to society and the global economy by the World Economic Forum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a fiduciary serving over 700,000 public-sector workers and retirees, I oversee a group of investment portfolios with more than $250 billion in assets. My office has taken comprehensive action to address climate risk and invest in climate solutions to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Asset owners of over $130 trillion globally have committed to net-zero goals to protect against systemic risks to their investments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But achieving these ambitious and necessary goals will require better information for investment decision-making than we currently have. Company disclosures of climate risks are often voluntary, incomplete and inconsistent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Investors have been calling for more comparable and consistent data. In 2021, 733 investors with $52 trillion in assets issued the Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis \u2014 the strongest ever call by major investors for the world\u2019s governments to require mandatory climate-risk disclosures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The S.E.C.\u2019s proposal is modeled closely on recommendations by a task force of the global Financial Stability Board that have been endorsed by more than 3,000 companies and many nations. Companies would be required to provide clear information on climate-risk exposure and report how they are managing those risks. The comment period for the proposed S.E.C. rule runs through June 17.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are, of course, voices pushing against these disclosures, including some business trade groups and Republican lawmakers, claiming the requirements are beyond the purview of the S.E.C. or too costly. They are wrong on both counts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agency\u2019s mandate is to protect investors. That is exactly what the regulation would do. Using reliable, analogous data required under the rule, investors would be better able to assess climate risk in their decision-making. The cost of assessing and reporting climate risk pales in comparison with the cost of not doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its latest report, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for an end to continued investments in fossil fuel production, warning that the world is off track to avert the dangers of increasingly extreme weather. It warned: \u201cClimate-related financial risks remain greatly underestimated by financial institutions and markets.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The S.E.C.\u2019s proposed rule mandating climate-risk disclosures offers an overdue, urgent, realistic opportunity for investors to get better estimates \u2014 and act on them \u2014 while they still matter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brad Lander is the New York City comptroller.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

As many people have pointed out over the years, the most obvious comparison among major US metro areas is between Boston, still relatively traditional in urban structure, and Atlanta, the Sultan of Sprawl; not long ago the cities were about the same population, although Atlanta is growing much faster. A comparison looks like this:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>where the CO2 number comes from Glaeser and Kahn (pdf). In brief, incomes are lower in dollar terms in Atlanta, but people are moving there all the same for the cheap housing. This sounds like a win, but you can argue that it actually reduces national income. Also, the Atlanta model \u2014 with only about 1/4 Boston\u2019s weighted population density \u2014 arguably leads to substantial external costs: more greenhouse gas emissions, in part because of slightly longer commutes, in part because of much lower use of public transit. And maybe lower social mobility, because sprawl leaves low-income workers stranded away from the jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, if you believe with George Will that the only reason liberals like public transit is because it diminishes individualism and makes us ripe for collectivism,and if you believe climate change is a gigantic hoax, and if you believe that social mobility is entirely about individual virtue as opposed to the economic environment, you won\u2019t see this as problematic at all.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

That\u2019s the equivalent of adding 170 million new cars to the road worldwide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The energy agency, which called the findings \u201ca strong warning for global efforts to combat climate change,\u201d detailed several big reasons CO\u2082 emissions are increasing again. Here\u2019s a look at the main ones:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Emissions are rising fastest in Asia</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roughly two-thirds of last year\u2019s emissions increase came from Asia, where fast-growing countries like China, India and Indonesia continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels as they lift themselves out of poverty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China, which is responsible for one-quarter of the world\u2019s industrial greenhouse gases, saw its emissions rise 1.7 percent in 2017, fueled by rapid economic growth and an increase in oil and natural gas use. The rest of developing Asia, including India and Indonesia, saw their overall emissions increase 3 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That jump in Asian emissions overshadowed cuts made elsewhere in the world: The United States, for instance, reduced its emissions 0.5 percent last year, driven by the growing deployment of renewable energy. Britain, Mexico and Japan also managed to cut their emissions. (The European Union over all, by contrast, saw emissions rise 1.5 percent.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Renewable energy is growing fast, but not fast enough</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Renewable energy \u2014 including wind, solar and hydropower \u2014 was the fastest-growing energy source worldwide in 2017. China alone installed as many solar panels last year as the entire solar capacity of France and Germany combined. And the prices for renewable technologies keep falling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The catch? Last year\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d growth in renewables, the I.E.A. said, satisfied only about one-quarter of the increase in global energy demand as the world\u2019s economy boomed. Fossil fuels supplied the rest. \u201cThe overall share of fossil fuels in global energy demand in 2017 remained at 81 percent,\u201d the agency\u2019s report said, \u201ca level that has remained stable for more than three decades despite strong growth in renewables.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the world wants to cut emissions quickly and meet the climate goals laid out in the Paris Agreement , the I.E.A. said, clean energy will need to grow about five times as fast each year between now and 2040 as it did last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coal made a small comeback</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past few years, coal demand has plummeted around the world as countries like the United States and China shift away from the most carbon-intensive of all fossil fuels. China, for instance, has been pushing to phase out coal use in residential heating in order to clean up the severe air pollution that is choking its cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But coal use rebounded slightly in 2017, rising by 1 percent, driven in part by an increase in coal-fired power in Southeast Asia. A particularly hot summer in China also led the country to run its existing coal plants more often to power air conditioning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet despite last year\u2019s uptick, there are signs that coal is falling out of favor worldwide. India\u2019s coal demand is growing at a slower pace than it did over the previous decade, as the country turns to solar power and other clean energy sources . And, the I.E.A. said, both China\u2019s and the world\u2019s coal consumption remains below the 2014 peak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>S.U.V. sales keep booming</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demand for oil rose 1.6 percent last year, much faster than the average annual pace over the previous decade. As oil prices have declined, more people in the United States and Europe are buying larger S.U.V.s , pushing up transportation emissions further.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The I.E.A. noted that electric cars, which do not use oil, are quickly making inroads in countries like China, as a result of aggressive government mandates and falling battery prices. \u201cFor now, however, the strong growth in electric-car sales remains too small to make a dent in oil demand growth,\u201d the agency said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Energy efficiency efforts are slowing</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to switching to cleaner sources of energy, countries can also curb their emissions by improving the energy efficiency of their factories and homes and vehicles, through policies like building codes and fuel-economy standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this score, however, the I.E.A. had bad news: In 2017, the energy intensity of the global economy \u2014 a measure of efficiency \u2014 improved by just 1.7 percent, a slower pace than in each of the previous three years. The agency noted that many countries appear to be easing up on government policies to improve energy efficiency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Brad Plumer\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) said the bills would lay the foundations for President Biden's proposed $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I commend my colleagues for their hard work helping craft these two bills to deliver what Americans expect and deserve: safe roads and bridges, reliable transit options and a robust passenger rail network, wastewater systems that aren't on the brink of failure, and a commitment to address the existential threat of climate change,\" DeFazio said in a statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final vote was 38-26, with two Republicans joining Democrats to support the bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democratic lawmakers and left-leaning groups say the bill represents a fundamental rethinking of the way the federal government approaches transportation policy \u2014 an effort to move beyond the highway-dominated approach of the 20th century. The five-year bill is separate from Biden's infrastructure push but embodies many of the ideas proposed by the president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It includes $343 billion for road and bridge construction, as well as highway safety \u2014 a boost of more than 50 percent over the last transportation bill Congress passed in 2015. It seeks to ensure that states maintain existing highway infrastructure before adding new lanes and would create programs aimed at reducing carbon emissions from driving.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill would significantly boost funding for other modes of transportation. It calls for $109 billion for transit and $95 billion for rail, including a tripling of funding to Amtrak, to $32 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the two Republican votes in support, the debate underscored partisan divisions over how the federal government should approach transportation policy. GOP leaders branded the legislation the \"My Way or the Highway Bill\" and sought to characterize it as hopelessly radical.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans proposed amendments that would have changed core provisions in the legislation, such as striking the policy of prioritizing existing roads and blocking money for California's high-speed rail project. Republicans also sought to include changes to the environmental review process for major projects, which they argue is unnecessarily slow and could be sped up without harming the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The meeting also underscored how differently the parties view the role of cars in the future of transportation. Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.) summed up the bill's approach in a tweet: \"No car? No problem.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The debate over provisions to require that states tend to existing roads and consider alternatives such as transit before widening highways highlighted the divide. Republicans argued that states need flexibility to spend money where they judged it to be most needed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said making it harder for states to expand roads would disadvantage rural communities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In that kind of a rural environment, single-occupancy vehicles are not the villain,\" Johnson said. \"They are the economic lifeblood that connect people to opportunity. The idea that we are going to slow down the kind of capacity-expansion projects that are necessary, to me is going to slow growth in these rural and tribal areas.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>DeFazio said states had pursued highway-widening projects for decades and needed to be pushed to consider different approaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A lot of states will never look for alternatives,\" he said. \"They're just stuck in the mode of 'pave it over. Pave more. Bulldoze more neighborhoods. Pave it more.' There are limits.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill includes $5.7 billion to fund almost 1,500 projects earmarked by individual members of Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Deron Lovaas, an environmental advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the bill a model for the kind of legislation Congress should pursue to battle climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This bill will provide the investments we need in transit, safe streets, vehicle charging stations, and reconnecting communities divided by highways,\" Lovaas said. \"Transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions, so addressing climate in this legislation is crucially important.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The committee's approval sends the package to the House floor, with Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) planning a vote for the week of June 28. Existing highway and transit programs are set to expire Sept. 30, and DeFazio said he's committed to passing a bill before then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That will mean negotiating with the Senate, which is working on its own version of the bill. One committee already has advanced a bipartisan $304 billion proposal for highway funding. That legislation is similar, in some ways, to the bill advancing in the House, and DeFazio has expressed optimism about a deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee unveiled a $78 billion contribution to the package. The bipartisan measure would boost funding for major transportation grant programs, fund safety agencies and provide $19 billion for Amtrak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Committee chairwoman Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said the bill would help the nation bounce back from the pandemic and was \"a down payment to thrive and compete in the innovation economy.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Securing a long-term funding bill is the top priority for groups representing state transportation officials and businesses involved in road construction. While some have expressed concerns about aspects of the House bill \u2014 such as the focus on highway repairs rather than new roads \u2014 many are pleased that legislation is moving forward after a failed push last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Consistent federal investment through a new, long-term surface transportation reauthorization, developed in consultation with federal, state and local partners, would help counties undertake much-needed infrastructure improvement and development projects,\" said Matthew Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Biden has been pushing for a grander infrastructure deal. An initial series of talks with one group of Republican senators ended this week without a bargain, but the White House says it will continue discussions with lawmakers from both parties.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

We rush to preserve those.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Dinosaur Valley State Park in Glen Rose, Tex., weeks of blazing heat have wrung the Paluxy River dry, revealing sets of dinosaur footprints that experts say date back 113 million years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some came from a creature called acrocanthosaurus, a three-toed, bipedal carnivore that looked like a slightly smaller Tyrannosaurus rex, according to Stephanie Garcia, a spokesperson for the park. As an adult, it would have stood about 15 feet tall and weighed about seven tons. Another set of footprints came from a four-legged, long-necked herbivore called sauroposeidon that stood a towering 60 feet tall and weighed about 44 tons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While dinosaur tracks themselves aren't particularly rare, they're important to researchers because they provide clues about how the animals lived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The tracks were made along an ancient, inland sea during the Cretaceous period,\" Garcia said. \"The dinosaurs stepped in thick mud that held their track shapes well with a lot of the detail.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With rain in upcoming forecasts, Garcia said the tracks will soon be covered again. Workers have cleaned, mapped, measured and photographed tracks to monitor changes over time. The park is also mulling solutions that would allow the tracks to survive longer if they're exposed again, according to Garcia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"However,\" she added, \"nothing the park can do can stop the forces of weathering and erosion forever.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Repeated cycles of exposure and covering-up can wear on fossils that would otherwise be protected by silt and sediment. Water flooding back into a dry area can erode rock and shoreline. Loose debris could bury or damage fragile specimens. Other fossils are at risk of being washed out by the advancing current. Intense storms pose similar dangers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These threats are accelerating as climate change worsens, adding pressure on scientists and field workers to protect these finds before they are destroyed or swept away, said Santucci, of the Park Service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Given the wild fluctuations in weather and precipitation, we can have these long dry periods exposing things and then catastrophic flooding,\" he said. \"The high-energy nature of those floods can completely destroy a fossil site.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In special cases, Santucci said, specimens are collected for safekeeping. More often, scientists inventory what they find, draw maps, take photographs, even create 3D models. Then they develop a plan for periodically monitoring the site to see what changes over time. Ultimately, Santucci said, they're at nature's mercy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have to come up with schedules to get out there really quickly,\" he said, \"before important fossils are lost forever.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the rapidly drying Danube, Europe's second-longest river, researchers investigating a graveyard of Nazi warships exposed by record-low waters may face similar problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The World War II-era vessels uncovered near the Serbian port town of Prahovo in August were part of a German Black Sea fleet that sank in 1944 while retreating from Soviet forces.

But it's also riddled with hazards: Serbian officials say there may be thousands of rounds of ammunition and other undetonated explosives inside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if researchers can safely reach the ships, they'll face a time crunch. In the short term, waters will return, reclaiming the sunken vehicles. In the longer term, rising and falling water levels driven by intensifying drought expose the metal structures to sunlight, rust-inducing oxygen and potentially volatile river conditions, all of which could affect their longevity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Any time we introduce any natural or cultural interference, we're talking about degradation and thinking about how long those sites are going to be around,\" said Jennifer McKinnon, a maritime archaeologist at East Carolina University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The flip side is that them being uncovered is an excellent opportunity for outreach, for the global community to understand history and see what only divers might have been able to see,\" she said. \"There's going to be some destruction, but you also understand the importance of that public exposure.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the Danube is revealing mankind's destructive side, other waterways have in recent months revealed a host of exhibitions in creativity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Buddhist statues built during the Ming and Qing dynasties cropped up on an island reef in the Yangtze, which is experiencing record-low water levels. In Spain, archaeologists were recently able to access an ancient monument known as \"Spanish Stonehenge\" in a Tagus River reservoir; it has seldom been visible since the area was flooded in the 1960s to build a dam. And in Iraq, the remains of a 3,400-year-old city came into view in June when drought sapped waters in a reservoir in the country's north.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fleeting view of these treasures comes at an enormous ecological cost. Drought ravages crops and strains livestock and native species. It worsens air quality and raises the risk of wildfires, among other environmental ills. As the planet warms, these cycles are all but certain to continue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We can look at it as a two-edged sword,\" Santucci said. \"We can document the adverse impacts of climate change but benefit from finding things that have been exposed due to the same factors.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

The Paris climate accords signed in 2015 were meant to deal with that issue and to slow rising temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The average global temperature is 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than it was 150 years ago, the agency said in a report, exacerbating heat waves and extreme weather on every continent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alongside that sobering data came what counts as progress on the contentious issue of who will pay for the irreversible damage that climate change is wreaking on the world\u2019s most vulnerable. For the first time, the topic of \u201cfunding arrangements\u201d for loss and damage was included on the conference\u2019s formal agenda, overcoming longstanding objections from the United States and the European Union.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s a win for a bloc of poor countries and emerging economies, backed by China, that say they have lost money, land, livelihoods and human lives because of climate hazards disproportionately caused by the greenhouse gas emissions of rich, industrialized countries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those countries, led by the United States and Europe, have long said they cannot agree to a separate pot of money that could open up endless claims for compensation. They softened their stance this year in agreeing to put loss and damage on the agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is far from settled. There is no agreement on whether to set up a compensation fund and certainly no allocation of money itself. \u201cSpace has been created for discussion,\u201d said Simon Stiell, the head of the United Nations climate change agency, which is leading these talks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a measure of how high frustrations are running, an organization of vulnerable island nations appealed for \u201csolidarity not charity.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe are not asking for favors,\u201d a statement from the Alliance of Small Island States said. \u201cWe will not be silent victims to the cost of pollution created by others, for the profit of the few.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Compounding crises loom over these talks, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic and Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine. Energy prices have skyrocketed, whetting appetites to develop more fossil fuel projects. Food prices have spiraled upward, too, plunging poor people deeper into hunger.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world\u2019s two largest greenhouse gas emitters, the United States and China, are barely speaking to each other, and the tensions between them are pitched on everything from trade to Taiwan. These strains will complicate efforts to achieve progress at the conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But none of those problems will have the long-lasting impact of climate change, Mr. Stiell said. \u201cClimate change is ever-present and will only get worse,\u201d he warned at a news conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The World Meteorological Organization report plainly laid out the catastrophic threat of climate change. Sea levels are rising at twice the rate they were 30 years ago. The ocean is hotter than ever. The concentrations of planet-warming carbon dioxide and methane are at their highest levels. This is exactly what scientific projections had been warning of for decades, the group\u2019s secretary general, Petteri Taalas, said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe projections were right,\u201d Dr. Taalas said.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The opening chapter, set in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, depicts a heat wave that kills millions across the subcontinent and galvanizes people to radical action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such dire warnings may seem far-fetched today. But the heat waves we are now experiencing are going to get worse. That, of course, will have dire consequences. More likely than mass death is mass migration. As Bill Gates points out, the area around the equator could become too hot for people to work outdoors; that could mean a decline in farming, the most common occupation in low-income countries. Stressed by heat, lack of water and no jobs, millions of people could start moving from these areas to more temperate climates mostly in the north: Europe and the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many climate activists are often focused on pledges to get to net zero emissions by some distant date or insist that every new energy source must be entirely green.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the reality is that we need to cut emissions now, not promise to do so by 2030. And the only way to do it now, and at scale, is to make some tough choices and trade-offs. We do not have green technology, like clean nuclear fusion and long-duration battery storage, that can fully replace fossil fuels today. We may get them \u2014 in 10 or 15 years, perhaps, if we are very lucky.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we don't have them now, and hoping that we do is part of what has caused an energy crisis around the world. Investment in fossil fuels has plunged over the past decade, while green technology has not been able to fill the gap. Germany cut back on nuclear energy and ended up burning more coal. California is phasing out nuclear and discouraging natural gas but is now confronting a sharp increase in the number of wasteful diesel generators being used for backup power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let me suggest a few practical ways to make progress in the next five years with technologies we already have.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We could start by converting the most polluting coal-fired power plants to natural gas, which emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal when combusted. A study surveyed 29,000 power plants around the world and found that 5 percent generate 73 percent of all emissions in the electricity-generation sector. In other words, replacing around 1,500 coal-burning plants would make a huge dent in emissions, a giant cut on par with the boldest plans being discussed today.If the West wants to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative, why not put together a coalition that would finance this effort across the planet?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is the problem of methane leakage from natural gas extraction, agriculture and landfills. This can be solved technically and just needs smart, tough regulations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should extend the life of nuclear power plants and start building smaller and safer ones. Nuclear energy evokes grim images, but the facts speak for themselves. In the 21st century, just a handful of people have died from nuclear accidents around the world, while more than 1,500 people died in oil and gas extraction in the United States alone from 2008 to 2017. Far more people die each year from lung diseases caused by coal pollution, with some estimates running into the millions \u2014 and that's without even factoring in the climate impacts. We should also keep working on developing new modular reactors that have much safer designs and are far less likely to have the same kind of meltdown problems that others have had in the past. And let me remind you, nuclear power plants produce nearly zero emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Plant 1 trillion trees. The science is simple: Trees absorb carbon dioxide. We are all impressed by Greta Thunberg, but what about Felix Finkbeiner? He's a young German environmentalist who, at the age of 9, proposed that every country commit to planting 1 million trees and then, at 13, upped the ante and suggested at the United Nations that we target 1 trillion by 2050. Let's start by curbing deforestation and planting as many trees as we can, as fast as we can.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yes, all of the solutions have their drawbacks. Planting trees may not do as much good as some scientists initially claimed. Nuclear power is expensive up front. Natural gas does emit some carbon. But the crucial point is that such measures would cut emissions a lot \u2014 and we can do them all now. We do not have to make a choice between half-measures now and full measures later when we have the technologies to do so. There are other proven technologies, ranging from weatherizing buildings to electric cars, and we should create incentives for them all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the saying goes, the perfect should not become the enemy of the good. That should be the motto of every environmental group that wants to see actual, positive change today.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

That\u2019s why I moved to Washington to start what I call Fire Drill Fridays, joining the millions of young people around the world who turned out in the fall for protests to demand that our leaders act to save their futures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must all face the harsh reality that our planet is rapidly approaching an irreversible tipping point, beyond which the unraveling of our ecosystems will be beyond our control. Scientists have made clear that we now have less than 11 years to reduce fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions roughly by half, and 20 years after that to cut them to net zero, to stabilize the rise in temperatures by the end of the century and meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last summer \u2014 as the wildfires wreaked havoc on my home state, California, and young people like Greta Thunberg so powerfully reminded us that we are the last generation that can prevent an unthinkable global catastrophe \u2014 I decided it was time for me to do more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many things we can all do. We can join protests, engage in civil disobedience and risk arrest, but we must also see this as the uniquely critical political moment it is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite widespread agreement among the world\u2019s scientists that we are living through a climate emergency requiring profound economic and social change, the United States government is failing to act. It\u2019s not that the American public doesn\u2019t want an end to wars over oil, or a stable climate, clean oceans, safe and abundant water and healthy air.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No. Let\u2019s be clear: Over decades the fossil fuel industry has hijacked our political system, and we have failed to elect enough leaders who are not beholden to the industry\u2019s interests. The Center for Responsive Politics has documented that the oil and gas industry alone has spent some $218 million on lobbying in 2018 and 2019. In addition, oil and gas interests have contributed about $27 million to Senate and House candidates and party committees in the 2020 election cycle. Fossil fuel interests are subverting our democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In just the past year, the United States has experienced deadly wildfires, devastating flooding and the hottest month ever recorded, all driven, at least in part, by climate change. What is President Trump\u2019s response? He\u2019s pulling the United States out of the Paris agreement and rolling back 85 environmental safeguards, including important and consequential climate initiatives. This should not be surprising; he once called climate change a \u201choax.\u201d The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is also blocking efforts to deal with the climate crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have reached a time in this fight when the only way forward is to organize, mobilize and vote politicians who won\u2019t act out of office. We must overcome the power of the fossil fuel industry and elect an environmental champion for president and a congressional leadership ready to move forward aggressively with a Green New Deal to save us and the planet, starting the day they take office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Winning at the ballot box is how we will succeed in building a more just and equitable economy, one thriving from good clean energy jobs. It\u2019s how we will secure a habitable planet for future generations. It\u2019s how we will protect our cherished public lands and species, and ensure all Americans have safe water and clean air \u2014 especially low-income communities and communities of color who for too long have borne the brunt of inaction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The good news is that a growing number of voters understand the urgency of the challenge we face. Two-thirds of Americans say the government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, including 90 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Some Democratic presidential candidates have released climate plans that match the urgency of the crisis. We must pressure others to do the same. We must not vote for any candidate who accepts money from the fossil fuel industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greenpeace is ranking the candidates based on their support for the Green New Deal and ending new fossil fuel extraction immediately. Through the Change the Climate 2020 program, the League of Conservation Voters is tracking what every candidate is saying about climate change. The group\u2019s political committee, the LCV Victory Fund, is scaling up campaigns in battleground states. I\u2019ve seen the details of the strategy and I\u2019m telling you we can win on climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must start to live our lives as if this is an emergency, because it is. Each of us one day will have to answer this question: What did I do to protect the planet for our children, grandchildren and so many precious species while we still had time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019ve still got a lot of fight left in me.

Barnett authored the executive summary of Wikistrat's report on future black market items.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everybody's making predictions for 2013 right now, but why not aim farther? Recently, the consultancy group Wikistrat ran a large crowd-sourced simulation to try to figure out what sorts of items would be smuggled in 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's right, smuggled. The idea is that you can tell a lot about a society by what's available on its black markets. And over the next four decades the combination of new technologies, environmental pressures and shifting consumer preferences is likely to lead to a whole slew of products and behaviors being banned or restricted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So here's what Wikistrat expects will thrive on the black market by 2050. Note that the group mainly focused on identifying new types of contraband -- no doubt old crowd favorites like drugs and guns will still be trafficked for decades to come:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Products that are bad for the environment, like coal. If the world ever does start seriously tackling climate change, then energy sources such as coal (or possibly even corn ethanol) could become contraband. That's not so far-fetched. Wikistrat's simulation was inspired by a recent New York Times piece on the heavy trafficking of HCFC-22, an air-conditioning coolant that's been banned in the United States because it chews up the ozone layer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unhealthy foods and products like cigarettes. With bans on smoking and trans fats popping up everywhere, it's not much of a stretch to think that one day we'll see thriving black markets in Fritos, cigarettes and even tanning booths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experimental health enhancers. The future could bring a whole host of new technologies, from \"software to create pleasurable sensory overloads\" to \"biotechnology allowing the creation of (truly) perfect babies,\" says Wikistrat. Many of those technologies may end up restricted. For instance, schools and communities may decide to bar cognition-enhancing drugs because they give certain students unfair advantages. In that case, they may thrive on the black market, much as steroids do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rare species. Scientists are already warning that millions of species could become extinct by 2050 because of human activity and climate change. Some useful species that are already dying out -- those mysteriously vanishing honeybees, perhaps? -- could be a hot black market commodity by mid-century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vanishing natural resources. Think about the strains on fresh water we're already seeing. Cities are growing fast. Many countries are depleting their groundwater aquifers. And climate change is melting crucial snowcaps. By 2050, many cities could be trying to poach all the fresh water they can -- much as Los Angeles had to swipe water from its desert neighbors in the early 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'd also add arable land to this list, something Wikistrat omitted. India and China are getting richer, and demand for meat is soaring among their populations. Yet crop yields in both countries are starting to stagnate. So the two nations are already starting to grab farmland abroad, in places such as Ethiopia, sometimes through dubious means. This isn't smuggling in the conventional sense, but it's already taking place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ways to go off-grid. The Wikistrat simulation seems to envision a future in which governments and businesses can track our every step. (This will be especially true if physical currency ever disappears.) If that happens, then there will be a vibrant black market in ways to \"mask individuals' movement through public spaces,\" to travel without being tracked and to log on to the Internet unseen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Future weapons. Drones could be a much-desired black market item in the future. Also, if 3-D printing ever takes off and allows anyone to create just about anything at home, then presumably certain designs and high-grade materials will be heavily restricted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Counterfeited cyber-currency. North Korea already (allegedly) makes plenty of money from counterfeit $50 and $100 bills. But what happens if cyber-currencies like Bitcoin become massive and start rivaling official currencies? Will a shadowy market emerge for counterfeit bitcoins and bitcents?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Passage to offshore \"sin cities.\" Some architects have long dreamed about creating floating cities in the ocean, outside national boundaries, where people can experiment with new types of societies. Offshore libertarian havens, essentially. So far, \"seasteading\" is mostly a sci-fi fantasy. But if it ever takes off, the business of smuggling people into such cities could become commonplace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the executive summary (pdf) to Wikistrat's report, written by Thomas P.M. Barnett. (Here's more about Wikistrat, which takes a Wikipedia-style approach to geostrategic analysis.) I wouldn't lay too much money down on any one specific prediction, but it's a fascinating way of looking at some of the trends that are already molding the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any other contenders for future black-market items?

Evan Weber, Sunrise's political director, said that the group is considering including an analysis of what candidates say on television and on other social media websites as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The social media emphasis shows just how much Sunrise \u2014 and young climate activists in general \u2014 value candidates who not only take their preferred policy positions, but also talk about what they regard as a global crisis loudly, clearly and in a way that gets more people to join the cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The intent of it is to evaluate how much the candidates are campaigning on the issue,\" Weber said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to the rest of the score, Sunrise stresses the candidates' plans need to be comprehensive \u2014 \"not just a 'climate bill,' a single policy, or a set of policies, but a governing vision,\" the scorecard reads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They also need to put the U.S. economy on a path to achieving net-zero emissions \"well before\" the middle of the century. And the proposals need to \"go beyond\" market-based mechanisms such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program, which have been at the center of Democrats' climate legislation in the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former vice president Joe Biden, who leads most polls for the Democratic nod, embraced the notion of a Green New Deal in June when he released his climate plan. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.),\u00a0the other two consistently top-polling candidates, each sponsored the Senate version of the Green New Deal resolution championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has promised to create more than 10 million well-paying jobs while putting the country on track for net-zero emissions at 2050 at the latest. Warren is pitching\u00a0a $3 trillion clean energy plan that involves creating a\u00a0\"Green Marshall Plan\" to encourage foreigners to buy U.S.-made green technologies. And Sanders wants to spend\u00a0$16.3 trillion over the next decade\u00a0with a goal of eliminating the use of fossil fuels from power plants in part by getting the federal government deeper into the business of generating electricity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another portion of Sunrise's\u00a0score will be calculated by their willingness to take certain steps to implement their plans, such as ending the Senate filibuster, curtailing gerrymandering and granting voting rights to felons. The only one of the three to openly support\u00a0an end to\u00a0the filibuster is Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sunrise's scorecard amounts to assessment markedly different from\u00a0the other well-known environmental scorecard for politicians in Washington: the one from the League of Conservation Voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LCV, which raises tens of millions of dollars for environmentally minded federal and state candidates every two years, issues annual scores of members of the House and Senate based solely on their voting record in each chamber. Biden, Warren and Sanders have lifetime LCV scores of 83 percent, 99 percent and 92 percent, respectively.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Sunrise Movement has already backed a number of Democrats in congressional races. Their endorsements include immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who is trying to unseat moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), and Edward J. Markey, senator from Massachusetts and author of the Green New Deal resolution with Ocasio-Cortez, in his tough primary race against Rep. Joe Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when it comes to the 2020 presidential race, many progressives are torn between Sanders and Warren. So for the moment, the Sunrise Movement is stopping short of backing a\u00a0presidential candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sunrise spokesman\u00a0Stephen O'Hanlon said the group is still \"considering whether or not to make presidential primary endorsement.\" The group plans on releasing scores for other presidential candidates at\u00a0a later date as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You are reading \nThe Energy 202\n, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 The latest on Rick Perry: Energy Secretary\u00a0Rick Perry is denying\u00a0reports that he's eyeing an exit from the Trump administration even as he appears increasingly entangled\u00a0in the Trump administration's policy toward Ukraine, which is at the center of a House impeachment inquiry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perry is looking to step down by the end of the year, The Post's Juliet Eilperin and Josh Dawsey reported,\u00a0adding he will probably return to the private sector.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Perry said when asked about those initial reports of his departure at a news conference in Lithuania,\u00a0per Reuters.\u00a0\"They've been writing the story for at least nine months now. One of these days they will probably get it right, but it's not today, it's not tomorrow, it's not next month.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perry said he \"absolutely\" asked Trump to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but both he and an aide say the push was to talk about energy and economic issues. \"Absolutely, I asked the president multiple times \u2014 'Mr. President, we think it is in the United States and the Ukraine's best interest, that you and the president of Ukraine have conversations, that you discuss the options that are there.' So absolutely, yes,\" Perry said\u00a0in\u00a0Lithuania. But\u00a0Perry told CBN News that the Biden family was not\u00a0brought up in discussions with Ukrainian officials: \"Not once, as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name \u2014 not the former vice president, not his son \u2014 ever mentioned.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a rough transcript of the July 25 phone call, the\u00a0president\u00a0ended up asking\u00a0\"a favor\" that included requests to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perry's\u00a0latest remarks follow a report from Axios\u00a0that Trump appeared to throw his energy secretary under the bus, telling House Republicans that it was Perry who urged him to make a July call to Zelensky. \"But Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a U.S. holdup in military aid to the country,\" AP\u00a0reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the very least, Politico reports, \"Perry played an active role in the Trump administration's efforts to shape decisions by the newly elected government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Among other changes, Perry pushed for Ukraine's state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz to expand its board to include Americans, two people familiar with the matter said. Two longtime energy executives based in Perry's home state of Texas were among those under consideration for that role, one source familiar with the administration's dealings with the company said.\"\u00a0At the news conference, Perry said he made recommendations to Ukraine's state-owned natural gas company but said he only did after a request from Ukraine's government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 In case you missed it: The latest installment of The Post's \"2C project,\" Anton Troianovski and Chris Mooney\u00a0highlight\u00a0the impact of a rapidly warming Siberia. In one region near the town of Zyryanka, in part of eastern Siberia, the area has warmed by more than 3 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial era, or roughly triple the global average. \"The permafrost that once sustained farming \u2014 and upon which villages and cities are built \u2014 is in the midst of a great thaw, blanketing the region with swamps, lakes and odd bubbles of earth that render the land virtually useless,\" they write. \"\u2026For the 5.4 million people who live in Russia's permafrost zone, the new climate has disrupted their homes and their livelihoods. Rivers are rising and running faster, and entire neighborhoods are falling into them. Arable land for farming has plummeted by more than half, to just 120,000 acres in 2017.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 AOC is raising money for her Green New Deal co-author: Ocasio-Cortez sent a fundraising email calling for donations to support\u00a0Markey\u00a0as he's set to face a primary challenge from Joe Kennedy III. In it, she cites a report that her 2018 primary opponent, former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), is fundraising for Kennedy. \"While Ed Markey is fighting for the Green New Deal in the Senate, Joe Kennedy is getting campaign support from Crowley hosting a high dollar fundraiser on October 15,\" the email reads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Disaster-response systems aren't keeping up with the changing climate: Nearly a year after the devastating fire in Paradise, Calif., there has been no independent investigation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has not completed its own after-action report. Experts say transparent assessments help improve the nation's disaster preparedness, The Post's Frances Stead Sellers\u00a0reports, especially as global warming makes disasters more frequent occurrences. \"Some have called for the creation of an independent body like the [National Transportation Safety Board] with investigatory powers, charged not only with determining the cause of disasters but also promoting safety,\" she writes. Thomas Kirsch, director of the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health at the Uniformed Services University, told The Post the \"disaster-response industry is probably the only industry left in the world that uses self-analysis to measure impact and make improvements.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Drill, baby, drill: The Trump administration is moving forward with plans\u00a0more auctions for oil and natural gas drilling rights across the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration issued a final decision to open 725,000 acres of California land to oil and gas drilling \u2014 land that has been off limits since 2013. The move, which the Bureau of Land Management says will still require additional approval, would allow plots of land to be leased\u00a0that are mostly in the state's Central Valley, the Associated Press reports. In a statement, Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the move a \"toxic convergence of Trump's climate denial, loyalty to the oil industry and grudge against California.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it plans to hold its next oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf on March 18. \"Lease Sale 254 will offer 78 million acres and 14,585 blocks, or nearly all available Gulf of Mexico waters not currently facing a drilling prohibition, such as much of the eastern Gulf, which remains under a congressional moratorium,\" S&P Global Platts reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Meet the climate protesters blocking traffic around the globe: Extinction Rebellion protesters have launched a two-week effort to block major roads and generally shut down dozens of cities worldwide in a push to urge people to take the climate crisis seriously. \"The group's message is that climate change is an emergency that requires drastic and immediate action. They have already seen some success,\" The Post's Karla Adam reports. \"But their tactics test public tolerance for social and economic disruption. Some say their specific demands are wildly unrealistic \u2026 The protesters are walking a tightrope \u2014 they want to spark enough disruption to effect change but not so much they alienate the public.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 \"It's exactly what we wanted\":\u00a0That's what a corn and soybean farmer and a Trump supporter told the New York Times\u00a0about the administration's plan to boost ethanol demand. \"The decision, which was cheered in a Corn Belt that has also been battered this year by tariffs and floods, underscored the importance of the rural Midwest to Mr. Trump's reelection hopes and gave a boost to farmers at the end of a difficult growing season,\" the\u00a0Times reports. After the Trump administration decided last August to exempt more oil refineries from the nation's biofuel mandate, \"Midwestern Republicans in Congress pressed the president to reverse course in a series of closed-door meetings, and farmers, who helped Mr. Trump sweep to victory in 2016, voiced their anger in unusually blunt terms.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Association of State Energy Officials and U.S. Energy Information Administration host a Winter Energy Outlook Webinar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Center for Strategic and International Studies holds an event on climate change and maritime sustainability, sovereignty and security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Smart Cities Connect Fall Conference and Expo begins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coming Up</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The House Science, Space and Technology Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight holds a field\u00a0hearing on addressing the lead crisis through innovation and technology on Oct. 15.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Meet \"Miracle\": A puppy now named Miracle was found alive in the Bahamas\u00a0after being trapped for weeks after Hurricane Dorian.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

The people of the region face many unknowns because of perceived threats and the imagined geopolitical battlefields of the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Distant Early Warning\" is my long-term project on the constantly evolving state of a perceived militarization of the North American Arctic from the legacy of the Cold War to facing the unknown threats from a shrinking ice cap and changing climate. I use the word \"perceived\" because since the Cold War, the militarization of the Arctic has been based on an imagined threat and attack that has evolved into many things. The changes in the region are exacerbated by the many unknowns the Arctic faces, among them the warming of the planet. In political capitals like Washington, where I live, regions such as the Arctic \u2014 which are inaccessible to nearly all of us to experience in person \u2014 can exist only in our imaginations via journalism or visual art like photography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Invented narratives, imagined possibilities and ideas around claiming territory, resource extraction and the new economic opportunities resulting from the loss of sea ice have elevated concepts about how to secure the Arctic. One of my key takeaways from years of on-the-ground fieldwork is that if any army ever tried invading North America over the North Pole, it would result in the biggest search-and-rescue operation in history, because nature is the most powerful force in the world, especially when the temperature is below minus-50 degrees. I have been to places in the Arctic where a medevac could take a week or more because of the weather, which is longer than in any war zone I have covered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After covering several wars \u2014 including in Afghanistan for nearly five years, Ukraine and the drug war in Mexico \u2014 I turned my attention to examining the growing geopolitical tensions and changing life around Canada's Inuit communities, Greenland and Alaska, which is just over 50 miles away from Russia. The fieldwork took place over years in one of the coldest and most geographically beautiful \u2014 but logistically challenging \u2014 places on the planet, excepting its Southern cousin Antarctica. I wanted to know what had happened to one of the oldest active imagined \"front lines\" in the world, which was once known as the DEW Line, a.k.a. the Distant Early Warning Line, now called the North Warning System. It was one of the largest construction projects in the North American Arctic. It is composed of radar and military installations from Alaska across Canada to Greenland and is still in operation today. I traveled 104,431 miles by airplanes large and small, 506 miles by helicopter, 5,882 miles by boat or ship, 91 miles by ATV (four-wheel and tracked), 210 miles by snowmobile, 3,473 miles by road vehicles, and 41 miles on foot, and the only threats I could see were those caused by global warming. Sometimes the most valuable tool I had was listening, which gave me a vast resource of history, political understanding and science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up in Canada and have photographed the Arctic since 1993, when diamonds were first discovered in Canada's far north. When I first flew 29 years ago into Yellowknife, a hub many use to fly north of the Arctic Circle, I was confronted by striking gold miners who had been deadlocked in a long, bitter standoff that resulted in a bombing that killed nine miners. It would be decades until I experienced the usual images of the Arctic most think of, like polar bears, but I was surprised that the animal I saw most was the raven, the smartest bird on the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In nearly three decades since first going to the Arctic, I have come to learn a few key things when it comes to the polar region that came out of my fieldwork for my visual reporting. The first thing I learned was that the Arctic is not one place or thing, but can be more than 100 issues and narratives depending on who you are and what your goal is. What I found was that I had to become a student and that Indigenous people are the original scientists of the Arctic. I have learned more about ancient technologies for navigating and understanding weather and animals from Inuit elders than anyone else, which has helped me see how the region is undergoing a drastic change that will affect our perceived safety to the south.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While traveling along the Northwest Passage, I began creating non-pictorial conceptual documentary photographs visualizing the environmental trauma of the region. I took 4-by-5-inch sheets of large-format film and instead of conventionally exposing them to light in a camera, I pressed them against the ground, rendering physical marks on the film reflecting the state of the planet in that spot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At one point while on an icebreaker with scientists, we passed Terror Bay, named after the HMS Terror, the British bomb ship that attacked Fort McHenry in Baltimore in 1814. The Terror was eventually turned into an exploration vessel, which took it to Antarctica and eventually the Arctic. In 1845 it sailed from England in search of a new shipping route from Europe to Asia. But the journey was ill-fated, and the sunken wreckage wouldn't be found until 2016 in Canada's Arctic. It wasn't clear until then that the ship, which in its time boasted the greatest naval knowledge and technology, had become trapped in the ice and crushed, all because the crew lacked the thousands of years of Inuit knowledge of nature and the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The exhibition \"Distant Early Warning\" is on view at the Albin O.

The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week, we look at the links between sustained heat and destructive wildfires. Also: A beautiful river has an invisible danger, and people are coping with record temperatures across the globe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A \u2018new climate\u2019 and California fires</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is burning, with at least 16 big wildfires statewide. The largest, in and around the northern city of Redding , has killed at least six people and burned more than a thousand homes and other structures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fires are nothing new in the state this time of year. It\u2019s fire season, after all, as it is elsewhere in the West. But something feels different this time, perhaps because, following the Santa Rosa fire last October, this is the second year in a row in which fire has destroyed large parts of a city.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are plenty of reasons for such destructive wildfires, including the fact that communities are encroaching more and more on forests, putting property and people at risk. But scientists say a climate change link is likely, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This summer\u2019s record-high temperatures \u2014 the thermometer reached 111 Fahrenheit on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles, in early July, for example \u2014 got most of the headlines. But from a fire perspective, individual records here and there are not as significant as extended periods of above-normal temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat has been really unusual in the Western U.S. this summer has been the sustained heat,\u201d said Alex Hall, a U.C.L.A. climate scientist. \u201cIt really pulls water out of vegetation, and that sets up conditions for big fires.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cA month of somewhat elevated temperatures has a much bigger impact than just one day of really extreme heat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt adds up.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s not unusual for weather patterns to linger in summer, when the jet stream that would normally move big air masses around shifts to the north. But lingering weather that is 15 to 20 degrees above normal is something else. That was the situation in much of the state in July, including in Redding, where daytime temperatures did not drop below triple digits for 14 days straight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Hall cautioned that no one had yet analyzed the sustained heat in California for the fingerprints of climate change. But he said he had no doubt that such a study would find that global warming made it more likely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe longer, the more sustained the signals are, the harder they are to explain through atmospheric circulation or the kinds of variability you associate with weather,\u201d he said. Rather, he added, it suggests the climate is shifting. \u201cIt\u2019s a new climate, if you will.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beautiful river, hidden danger</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When my colleague Tryggvi Adalbjornsson and I arrived on the Tittabawassee River in Michigan, one of the first things that struck us was the river\u2019s beauty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We were there to report on a former Dow Chemical lawyer who has been nominated to run the nation\u2019s Superfund toxic cleanup program.

Wright, for years was in charge of Dow\u2019s legal strategy during the company\u2019s cleanup of extensive dioxin contamination \u2014  linked to Dow\u2019s sprawling headquarters in Midland, Mich. \u2014 along the Tittabawassee floodplain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our story found that Mr. Wright and his colleagues at the time were accused by regulators \u2014 and in one instance, by an internal whistle-blower \u2014 of mishandling data on contamination, misrepresenting scientific research on the health risks of dioxin and slowing the Tittabawassee cleanup, one of the nation\u2019s most intractable Superfund projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cleanup continues today, and there are signs along the Tittabawassee, and downstream along the Saginaw River and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron, warning fishermen that certain fish are considered especially risky because of dioxins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But because dioxin, linked to a host of health issues including cancer, is mostly an unseen danger, the river\u2019s beauty remains, framed by gorgeous, lush banks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As one local resident, Alice Buchalter, told us, \u201cWe thought that we had moved to paradise.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read our story , and let us know what you think.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Surprised by the heat? Don\u2019t be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems like it\u2019s been abnormally hot so far this summer in many places around the world, in many different climate zones. For scientists, though, it was no surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the ratcheting up of greenhouse gas emissions, they said, new heat records are bound to be set frequently. In short, get ready for more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, what did these record hot days and weeks feel like? We asked people in five different countries , in five very different climate zones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here are our interviews with people in each of those places.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elena Manaenkova, deputy head of the World Meteorological Organization, said this year was \u201cshaping up to be one of the hottest years on record\u201d and that the extreme heat recorded so far wasn\u2019t surprising in light of climate change. \u201cThis is not a future scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we\u2019re reading</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our colleagues at The New York Times Magazine have published a special issue,  \u201c Losing Earth ,\u201d entirely devoted to one article by Nathaniel Rich. In it, he presents the history of the decade from 1979 to 1989, when, he argues, humanity had a chance to save the planet from climate change \u2014 and blew it. Mr. Rich worked on the story for more than a year, and it\u2019s accompanied by visuals from the aerial photographer George Steinmetz.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We\u2019d love your feedback on this newsletter.

What he doesn't say is that our Lancet Countdown report explicitly disaggregates the effect of demographic changes from that of heat-wave incidence in assessing exposure of vulnerable age groups, precisely to avoid deceptive reporting. We also stated that \"insufficient data sharing and reporting restrict the capacity to produce accurate estimates globally.\" In Qatar, few of the 6,000 deaths reported among World Cup construction workers mention heat stress as a cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Behind this discussion lies an ethical conflict. Older generations have enjoyed enormous benefits from industrialization, mostly based on fossil fuels. But global heating from fossil-fuel greenhouse gases leads to extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, wildfires, reduced crop yields, increased risk of infectious disease, biodiversity loss and sea-level rise, all with effects on health and survival. We are putting our children's future in the balance. The generational injustice can't be ignored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A zero-carbon future brings many health benefits. Our conservative estimates suggest 1.2 million deaths annually could be prevented with no exposure to fossil-fuel-derived small-particulate-matter air pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lomborg pairs deaths from extreme heat with the reduction in cold-related mortality. But our capacity to adapt to extremes of heat is limited, and heat-related mortality rises with temperature at a more rapid pace than cold-related mortality falls. Multiple studies show that rising temperatures will result in a net increase in related mortality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prof. Anthony Costello</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marina Romanello, Ph.D.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>University College London</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Costello and Ms. Romanello are Lancet Countdown's chair and director.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lancet Countdown Responds on Heat Deaths\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

I don\u2019t want us to finish doing one big thing and have that be it \u2014 I want to keep it chugging along.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The group\u2019s effort to take on an aggressive and expansive agenda reflects the enormous energy on the far left heading into the 2020 election, and part of the appeal of democratic socialism in this cycle: setting an array of big goals to help deepen a movement that goes beyond one-off protest events and marches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many young, progressive Americans, democratic socialism is a far better representation of their ambitions of far-reaching structural change across the economy and society than the agenda of the Democratic Party, which they see as overly influenced by corporate interests, big-money donors and moderate traditionalists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The attempt at Ohio State to define objectives also comes as the Democratic presidential contenders are locked in a battle over what direction the party should take in order to win in 2020. That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country. (Ms. Warren, who has pulled ahead of Mr. Sanders in polling and is a leading candidate for the nomination, backs many of the same progressive priorities as Mr. Sanders, but has also said she is \u201ca capitalist to my bones.\u201d)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The national leaders of the Young Democratic Socialists of America have seized on Mr. Sanders\u2019s momentum with younger voters to expand their group\u2019s membership, too, growing from 25 registered chapters in 2016 to 84 in 2019, according to a Y.D.S.A organizer. Chapters have begun to spring up at high schools, as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chapter at O.S.U. was small for the past two years, with only 10 or 11 active members. Still, the group managed to create a campus campaign around Fight for $15, an effort to raise the minimum wage of university staff members to $15 an hour. They won that battle in August.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, each meeting draws 40 to 50 members, each one with a different reason for joining and something unique to fight for.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many of them, Mr. Sanders was their introduction to the left. They see the D.S.A. as more than just a vehicle to advance the rights of workers \u2014 it is also a home for progressive policies and issues that they don\u2019t see being addressed by the major political parties in a way they agree with.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re totally abandoning capitalism per se, but certainly they\u2019re more likely to embrace policies tied to what we characterize as socialism,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, chair of the political science department at Washington College in Chestertown, Md., who is working on a book about the political engagement of Generation Z. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in free college tuition or in expanding health care.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As they grew up in the wake of a recession and watched the effects of climate change unfold, the Black Lives Matter movement form and gay marriage be legalized, the students were often just a click away from finding the next progressive policy to support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nathan Webster, a second-year electrical engineering major at Ohio State, learned about the Democratic Socialists of America through protests in his hometown, Painesville, Ohio, aimed at abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI come from a largely Latino town \u2014 some of my friends lost their parents to Border Patrol,\u201d Mr. Webster said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNear the end of high school, I realized what politics were and where I fall on the political spectrum,\u201d he added. \u201cOriginally I told myself, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m a Democrat,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t know any better. I didn\u2019t know that there was something that could be more left.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Ricky Vehar, an environmental engineering major, coming out as gay and then coming out as trans moved her closer to the Young Democratic Socialists of America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFrom my background, you wouldn\u2019t really expect me to become super left. I grew up in a middle-class family, in a good suburb,\u201d she said, adding that watching \u201cthe discrimination that those communities face not just because they\u2019re gay or trans, but because the system incentivizes discrimination against them, moved me toward the left.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James Fisher, a second-year student and a co-chair of the O.S.U. chapter, joined the group for similar reasons: they support giving trans teenagers and adults better access to health care through Medicare for All.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cMedicare for All can benefit the trans community in their ability to get good health care, and that\u2019s something that a lot of trans people struggle with,\u201d Mx. Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s embedded in the language of Medicare for All, that there\u2019s no exclusionary measures to it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Others joined the Y.D.S.A. because they saw the benefits of nationalized health care firsthand. During a yearlong program in England, Johnny Amundson got very sick and was hospitalized for a month. His program enrolled him in the National Health Service, and he ended up paying just $200 in medical fees, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI saw that there\u2019s a difference between being able to have insurance, which my family has, and being able to have health care,\u201d Mr. Amundson said. He is now a fourth-year journalism and Russian double major at Ohio State, and he was one of the first members of the university\u2019s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nikki Velamakanni, a political science major, joined Y.D.S.A. when she realized that she didn\u2019t want to join the College Democrats chapter on campus because of the stigma around it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s known to be more centrist, it\u2019s known to be more compromise-y,\u201d Ms. Velamakanni said. \u201cWhereas the left is more, \u2018We stand for this and we\u2019re going to fight for it.\u2019\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Deckman attributes the rise of the Y.D.S.A. to the changing perceptions that younger voters and soon-to-be voters have about government and democratic socialism, and the idea that younger people tend to be more liberal with each passing generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey\u2019re more willing to have a bigger role for government to play in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThis younger generation is growing up seeing what deregulation is doing to the Earth, is doing to their ability to afford college, among other things. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re finding democratic socialist ideas appealing.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of their parents were introduced to socialism during the Cold War, giving the word an entirely different meaning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOlder Americans who lived during the Cold War, they link socialism strongly to communism. So there\u2019s this idea that if we raise socialism, our freedoms, especially religion, are going to be compromised,\u201d Dr. Deckman said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that sort of baggage matters to younger Americans.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Evan Schmidt, a second-year economics major, \u201csocialism is a word only. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a direct correlation to any sort of regime or empire, which allows for that reconstruction around it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He grew up in Manchester, Vt., where the idea of democratic socialism was less taboo thanks to Mr. Sanders. When he moved away, out of what he describes as a \u201csheltered neighborhood,\u201d he had his first experiences with people who grew up with less than he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It ignited his passion for democratizing the workplace and helping others to achieve the same class mobility his family enjoyed. He joined the Young Democratic Socialists of America, he said, because he thinks \u201cit\u2019s what the Democratic Party should be.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

While the departing government, in which Mr. Scholz is finance minister, has borrowed heavily to cover the economic costs of the pandemic, Mr. Scholz's aides said his government would use debt to fuel growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The coalition agreement pledged to boost innovation and reduce the country's CO2 emissions by sourcing more power from renewable sources. Mr. Scholz told journalists in Berlin that his government would aim to modernize the state and the economy, and improve social cohesion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The future coalition pledged to raise the minimum wage from nearly 10 to 12 euros an hour and build 400,000 new apartments, including 100,000 low-rent units, in an effort to contain the rising cost of living, Mr. Scholz said. While it will guarantee existing pension benefits despite Germany's rapidly aging population, the government will flank the current pay-as-you-go system with a state pension fund that will invest part of workers' contributions into shares.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The partnership with the U.S. will remain one of the pillars of Germany's foreign policy, Mr. Scholz added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy program revealed a key difference between Mr. Scholz and Ms. Merkel on the EU, said Guntram Wolff, director of Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank. While the warnings about inflation and the commitment to solid public finances were signs of German continuity, he said, the government manifesto also called for EU-wide investments and for the bloc's fiscal rules to be simplified and made more flexible. The document states that the government would work toward making the bloc a federal state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Merkel never wanted to open up fundamental issues in the EU and she was not interested in profound reforms, but Mr. Scholz now states from the onset that his government will push for fundamental reform of the union,\" Mr. Wolff said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Scholz is a veteran politician whose popularity has risen during the pandemic. He served twice as minister during Ms. Merkel's 16-year reign, the first time between 2007 and 2009, when he was in charge of labor and social affairs and helped shape Germany's successful response to the financial crisis. He became finance minister and vice chancellor in 2018, and has since played a key role in shielding Germany's economy from the fallout from the pandemic, as well as in drafting a massive investment fund designed to help the EU's ailing economies emerge from the disruption caused by the virus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A partner in a law firm he helped set up, Mr. Scholz served as mayor of his native Hamburg between the two stints in the federal government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under Mr. Scholz, Germany's Finance Ministry was transformed from an intellectual bastion of fiscal austerity to one more accepting of borrowing as a source of funding\u2014especially given the negative borrowing costs Germany currently enjoys.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Following an initiative largely driven by Mr. Scholz, the EU agreed for the first time in 2020 to issue large amounts of common debt to finance the coronavirus recovery. Mr. Scholz has compared his efforts to achieve closer fiscal integration of the EU to those of Alexander Hamilton, who introduced the ability of the federal states to issue common debt\u2014a step favored by the now designated German chancellor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Key ministerial posts under Mr. Scholz as chancellor will be divided among the three partners: FDP leader Christian Lindner will become finance minister; the co-chair of the Greens, Robert Habeck, will head an expanded Economy Ministry with oversight over climate and energy policy; and his ally, Annalena Baerbock, will become Germany's first female foreign minister, according to the people familiar with the talks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Germany's foreign relations, which have traditionally been shaped by the country's trade interests, are unlikely to change substantially under Mr. Scholz. But the appointment of Ms. Baerbock, a vocal supporter of human rights and critic of nondemocratic regimes, could herald a change of tone in diplomatic relations with Russia and China, Germany's largest trade partner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tackling the pandemic will be the government's most immediate key challenge, Mr. Scholz said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Coronavirus is sadly not yet defeated\u2026despite vaccination\u2026intensive-care stations are reaching their limits,\" Mr. Scholz said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Scholz, who prefaced his comments by urging Germans to keep contacts to a minimum given the high Covid-19 case numbers, said his chancellery would build a new pandemic task force made up of politicians and scientists, and increase vaccination capacities by allowing pharmacies and mobile teams to offer shots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One priority for the government will be to address the difficulties that have plagued the country's export-oriented manufacturers , such as auto makers and capital-goods producers, which are struggling with parts and labor shortages, tougher climate regulations and surging electricity bills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of its toughest challenges will be to put Germany's energy transition back on track. The country has failed to meet its greenhouse-gas emission targets because a 2011 decision to accelerate a phaseout of nuclear power has made it more reliant on coal and gas, something the parties of the coming coalition have pledged to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>German Election</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Germany's Scholz Vows to Overhaul Economy as Next Chancellor</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Bojan Pancevski\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

More than 100 former world leaders have urged the G-7 to cover two-thirds of the estimated $66 billion that it will cost to vaccinate low-income countries. A celebrity-backed appeal from UNICEF, meanwhile, asks the G-7 nations to donate 20 percent of their vaccine supplies by August.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Discussions are also likely to center on how to ensure that world economies bounce back from the pandemic, and what that recovery should look like. A report requested by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month concluded that the G-7 had a unique opportunity to rebuild by funding a transition to climate-friendly energy sources, and called for $10 trillion in investments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The looming crisis posed by climate change is expected to be one of the summit's major themes. Although all the leaders in attendance have acknowledged the problem, they will face pressure to announce concrete policies designed to tackle it head-on. According to the Times, Johnson intends to press leaders to sign onto a climate \"Marshall Plan\" that would fund renewable energy projects in developing nations in Africa and Asia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Australia and India \u2014 included in the summit as guests, along with South Africa and South Korea \u2014 are the only nations in attendance that have not pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and are facing pressure to do so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trade and taxing corporations</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ahead of the summit, G-7 nations reached a historic deal to set a minimum global corporate tax rate, aimed at ending the \"race to the bottom,\" in which companies move overseas to reduce their tax obligations. That agreement is only the first step, however: The Group of 20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development still have to sign off on the deal, and the process of rewriting international tax laws is expected to be long and complicated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, questions about the logistics of the arrangement have emerged, such as how leaders can guarantee that it will be approved and enforced by every country. There's also some debate about whether the 15 percent minimum tax rate is high enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, trade representatives from the G-7 countries signed a communique committing to \"free and fair trade as foundational principles and objectives of the rules-based multilateral trading system.\" Not everyone, however, agrees on how to get there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Biden is expected to focus in part on preventing China from using trade relations to punish its critics. Johnson's team has called for changing World Trade Organization regulations, with actors such as China in mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Northern Ireland Protocol \u2014 a sensitive part of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union \u2014 will also probably top the trade agenda, as Biden and European leaders are expected to pressure Johnson not to renege on the pact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brexit</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the summit being held in Britain, the issues surrounding the country's protracted exit from the European Union will be on full display. British newspapers reported Thursday that the Biden administration had issued a d\u00e9marche \u2014 a formal diplomatic message \u2014 warning that the British government is \"imperiling the Northern Ireland peace process over Brexit.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told the BBC this week that \"our concern runs very deep on the Northern Ireland issue\" but did not link it to a proposed free trade agreement between Britain and the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tensions between Britain and E.U. member states also remain high, with Europeans starting legal action over alleged breaches of a long-delayed exit deal. One dispute has been dubbed the \"Sausage War,\" with Britain accused of delays in the enforcement of promised controls and inspections of goods passing between Britain and Northern Ireland across the Irish Sea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Russia and Belarus</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has made it clear that he views the solidarity against autocratic nations one of his key aims of the summit \u2014 and notably, immediately after the gathering he will join Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva for their first in-person meeting as world leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an op-ed published before his trip, Biden wrote at length about his meeting with the Russian leader, noting that Western countries will be standing \"united to address Russia's challenges to European security, starting with its aggression in Ukraine.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also at stake will be Putin's ongoing support for Belarusian autocrat Alexander Lukashenko, who has refused to relinquish power despite mass protests following a disputed election last year, instead turning his state's security forces on critics and activists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further sanctions on Belarus are expected to be debated at the summit. British government officials said last month that the G-7 would discuss \"Belarus's reckless and dangerous behavior\" but would not agree to a request by France to invite opposition figures to the event.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rebuilding international ties in the post-Trump era</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's flight to Cornwall marked his first overseas trip as U.S. head of state \u2014 and the first face-to-face gathering of world leaders since Donald Trump's presidency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the agenda for Biden will be mending and strengthening ties with U.S. allies following four years of Trump's isolationist \"America First\" approach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're going to make it clear that the United States is back and democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and the issues that matter most to our future,\" Biden said Wednesday after landing in Britain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our alliances weren't built by coercion or maintained by threats. They're grounded in democratic ideals, a shared vision of the future, where every voice matters,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has taken a far more adversarial stance than Trump against Putin. On Thursday, he warned Russia that there would be \"robust and meaningful\" repercussions if it engages in \"harmful activities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's rhetoric has also centered on strengthening democratic institutions and combating autocracies, which Trump at times praised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have to expose as false the narrative that the decrees of dictators can match the speed and scale\" of current challenges, Biden said Wednesday. \"You and I know they are wrong. But it doesn't mean that we don't have to work harder than ever to prove that democracy can still deliver for our people.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Maybe not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you want to mark an unnatural, scary, real-world data point for climate change, it is here in Britain, right now, where temperatures are forecast to soar as high as 40 Celsius \u2014 104 Fahrenheit \u2014 on Tuesday, an extreme weather episode, a freak peak-heat, not seen since modern record keeping began a century and a half ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And probably not since weather observation got serious here in 1659. And maybe far longer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hitting 40C, for British climate scientists, is a kind of a unicorn event that had appeared in their models but until recently seemed almost unbelievable and unattainable this soon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Houston? Islamabad? New Delhi? Hardly surprising when they're hot as a furnace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But London? The high-latitude city \u2014 with its recorded history dating back to the Romans \u2014 has probably never experienced temperature such as those as forecast today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Surely no Briton alive now \u2014 or his or her great-great or great-grandparents \u2014 has felt 40C without traveling abroad. Queen Victoria, Charles Darwin, William Shakespeare, Henry VIII? They never faced down a 40C day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This nation was not built to withstand such heat. Its homes, workplaces, roads, rails, hospitals and infrastructure were constructed for temperate weather \u2014 Shakespeare's \"other Eden, demi-paradise\" \u2014 not this inferno.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Britain has some of the most extensive weather records in the world, logged via diaries, observation and instruments as far back as the Age of Enlightenment, including daily records archived since the 1770s and monthly maximums and minimums dating back to 1660s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Currently, the highest official temperature is 38.7\u00b0C (101.7\u00b0 F), recorded at the Cambridge Botanical Gardens on July 25, 2019. Almost all the highest recorded temperatures occur in recent years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are absolutely confident we have not recorded a 40C day going back to the mid 1850s,\" Mark McCarthy, manager of National Climate Information Centre for the Met Office, told The Washington Post, referring to the beginning of the weather service's instrument-measured temperature records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alexander Farnsworth, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Bristol, was willing to travel back further in time. \"There is no direct evidence that the U.K has exceeded 40C in the past 6,000 or so years,\" he told The Post.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be back to the middle Holocene.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With caveats, Farnsworth warned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To go deep into prehistory, before instrument data, scientists must rely on proxies that tell them average temperatures over long periods of time \u2014 looking at lake and marine sediments, ice cores, corals, glaciation, bugs in bogs, tree rings, and such, to estimate past climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past 2,000 years, it did get warmer in Britain during the Medieval Warm Period \u2014 between 750 and 1350 \u2014 but probably not as hot as the late 20th and early 21st centuries, most scientists say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The medieval Domesday Book, completed in 1086 as a kind of census, tallied 45 vineyards in Britain, as far north as York \u2014 so it was warm enough to grow grape vines, a tradition brought to the island by the ancient Romans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there was the Little Ice Age, from 1300 to 1850, when the Northern Hemisphere grew colder again. This warming and cooling was not caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases, as today, but by the subtle tilt and wobble of the planet as it faced the sun.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, representing the authoritative consensus of world scientists, reported in 2021 that overall, and on average, the Earth is now warmer than it's been in 125,000 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some experts in paleoclimate studies say it's possible that to top 21st century heat in Britain, you'd have to go back to the Miocene Climatic Optimum, about 15 million years ago, when the world looked quite unlike today. Back then, the continents were bumping around. There were different seas and mountain ranges. There were mammals, but no humans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Myles Allen, a professor of geoscience at Oxford University, suggested caution. He said it was clear from the 1850s onward there has never been a day with 40C. But the further one looks back in time, the fuzzier the picture may be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One remarkable thing, Allen said, is how accurate climate models have become \u2014 both at forecasting the future and looking backward in time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers at the Met Office have reported that in the \"natural climate\" of the preindustrial world, there might be one day in every 7,000 years that Britain could face 40C.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the likelihood is once every 100 to 300 years \u2014 and growing. According to the models, a 40C day could happen once every 15 years by 2100 if countries meet their carbon emission promises \u2014 or once every 3 or 4 years if they continue to emit as much pollution as they do today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simon Lee, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University, who was born and raised in North Yorkshire, England, wrote on his blog that the idea of 40C is was a \"seemingly unthinkable temperature for a country with an aging population which does not have widespread residential air conditioning.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But \"everything changed\" on June 30, he wrote, with the publication of a Global Ensemble Forecast System model forecast dotted with 40C across southeast England. \"Given that the UK's previous hottest days had only seen 38\u00b0C exceeded very locally, this was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before.\" Scientists were initially skeptical. No more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hannah Cloke, a natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading, told The Post, \"We thought the models were wrong,\" but today we are \"sitting in the middle of a changing climate.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's unprecedented,\" she said, this kind of forecast, \"where we might see and feel something we've never experienced here before.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Cohn, the president\u2019s economics adviser, who was at the Italy summit meeting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The exit of the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter from the Paris accord would profoundly weaken the landmark effort to curb climate change . It could pave the way for other countries to withdraw, or to simply weaken their own commitments to cutting planet-warming pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even as the leaders themselves mounted a concerted campaign to persuade a skeptical American president to stay, negotiators for the seven nations who gathered at the Hotel San Domenico here sought to reach agreement on a joint statement that might pave the way for a decision by Mr. Trump in the days to come.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American officials were pushing for an acknowledgment that if the United States stayed in the Paris agreement, it would be allowed to lower the emission-reduction targets that the Obama administration had signed on to, according to people briefed on the negotiations. United States officials argued that those targets would harm the American economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aides to Mr. Trump were also pressing for language in the statement that would reassure coal producers in the United States that remaining in the Paris accord would not get in the way of the president\u2019s efforts to help their struggling industry. The United States was pressing for the agreement to specifically welcome the use of so-called clean coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many environmentalists are worried that such provisions would significantly undermine the effectiveness of the global effort to reduce global warming. Others believe that keeping the United States as a party to the agreement is worth making some compromises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It remained unclear on Friday night whether a joint statement, if one is issued, would result in a clear commitment by the United States to stay in the accord, or a vague message leaving open the possibility that Mr. Trump could still decide to end American participation in the global agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew Light, who was a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under President Barack Obama, said the other leaders at the summit meeting \u2014 representing the G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, along with the European Union \u2014 would go home frustrated \u201cif Trump blows this thing up and continues to sit on the fence.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other leaders confronted Mr. Trump on climate change as soon as he arrived in Europe. White House officials said Emmanuel Macron, the French president, brought the subject up during NATO meetings in Brussels, as did Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister. In Sicily, White House officials braced for what they knew would be \u201ca robust discussion\u201d of the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lobbying continued throughout the day on Friday, as the leaders gathered behind closed doors for a series of meetings, luncheons and a dinner, taking a break for an evening concert in the Teatro Antico di Taormina, an ancient amphitheater overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During one extended discussion on Friday, Mr. Trump listened to the pleas of the other leaders, White House officials said, but reiterated that the environment and jobs were both important to him. He talked about environmental awards he had received and declined to say when he would make a decision on the Paris agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI want to get to the right decision,\u201d Mr. Trump told the group, according to Mr. Cohn.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other leaders were said to be wary of how they spoke to the American president, concerned that they could anger him easily, which could result in his deciding to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement after he returns home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey are all trying to figure out how do you offer convincing arguments to Trump without him feeling that you are ganging up on him,\u201d said Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cohn insisted that the president was willing to listen to his counterparts, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s heard arguments that are persuasive on both sides.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president has long been on the record lashing out against the Paris climate agreement, insisting that it is bad for American businesses and will cost jobs in the United States. Speaking to a group of oil rig workers last May, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the accord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As president, Mr. Trump has moved swiftly to dismantle former Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policies, making it all but impossible for the United States to meet its current commitments under the Paris deal. The question still on the table is whether to remain part of the Paris agreement while scaling back Mr. Obama\u2019s commitments to cutting emissions of planet-warming pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pushing for the United States to leave the accord are Mr. Trump\u2019s senior strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt; and several other advisers who see a withdrawal from the Paris deal as the fulfillment of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to the nation\u2019s fossil fuel workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, joined by Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have urged the president to remain in the deal. Mr. Tillerson, who as chief executive of Exxon Mobil emerged as a major corporate backer of the Paris deal when it was completed in 2015, has said that the United States needs to keep \u201ca seat at the table\u201d in the global efforts to address human-caused climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even some Republican foreign policy experts have made the case that withdrawing from the deal could have negative effects on Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to push other elements of his foreign policy agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHe wants to understand how we can bring back manufacturing, bring back jobs, but still be environmentally friendly, but not have a restriction enforced upon us that makes absolutely no sense,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other countries have vowed to continue to implement the terms of the Paris Agreement, with or without the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Xi Jinping of China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, has vowed repeatedly to move ahead with steps in his country to curb climate-altering pollution regardless of what happens in the United States.

Although nothing compels entities to comply, the expectation is that companies that sign up to the net-zero pledge will want to adhere to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thousands of corporations as well as cities, counties, private investors and others have in recent years pledged to stop adding carbon emissions into the atmosphere by 2050. But those \u201cnet zero\u201d pledges are voluntary, and even the guidelines that do exist still allow entities to pour money into coal, oil and gas.

Even though these so-called \"carbon sinks\" occupy only 5 to 8 percent of the Earth's surface, they hold about 20 to 30 percent of the Earth's carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Globally, wetlands are rapidly disappearing due to rising oceans and ramped-up erosion, which are unearthing these age-old stockpiles of carbon. But bodies of freshwater are also a concern.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Illinois, Lake Michigan water levels are at their highest in 20 years, and those levels are predicted to continue climbing into the spring, swallowing more coastal wetlands in areas such as Illinois Beach State Park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"These wetlands are storing a lot of carbon, and I think this is another way of valuing this habitat,\" said Ethan Theuerkauf, a coastal geologist at the Illinois State Geological Survey and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Geological Survey recently launched a study to determine whether these wetlands are now releasing more carbon than they are trapping. Illinois Beach, an area that has eroded about 21 feet in the past six months in some spots, will give researchers an idea of how rising lake levels may be affecting the 500,000 acres of coastal wetlands across the Great Lakes basin.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Theuerkauf has profiled erosion's effect on coastal wetlands in North Carolina, where a rising sea level is drowning salt marshes, seagrass and mangroves, and ocean waves are uncovering the habitat's more than five centuries' worth of stored carbon. His research found erosion had turned one wetland into a source of carbon decades ago and another is on pace to begin releasing carbon by 2021</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"At Illinois Beach State Park, wetlands along the shoreline are eroding into the lake through the same process,\" Theuerkauf said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers are analyzing soil samples to determine age and carbon content. The research is expected to show how much carbon is at risk of being freed once the wetland soil erodes, but it's difficult to pin down where the carbon goes from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies show some of the buried carbon could become carbon dioxide and return to the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Some of it may be redeposited in adjacent wetlands or other habitats, and some of it may be exported back into the atmosphere,\" Theuerkauf said. \"Given the possibility of export back into the atmosphere, protecting wetlands from eroding and liberating the stored carbon is important.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As extreme weather events such as Hurricane Harvey and the California wildfires create a growing sense of urgency about man-made carbon emissions, losing natural habitat that provides long-term storage for carbon is troubling, scientists say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As carbon dynamics become more important to us to determine what's affecting climate change, I think anything we can learn to better understand what's driving that is useful,\" said Gary Sullivan, an ecologist for Chicago-based conservation group The Wetlands Initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Geological Survey study coincides with a period of above-average water levels across the Great Lakes, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. Lake Michigan, in particular, is nearly 1 1/2 feet above its long-term average and more than 4 feet higher than the record low in 2013.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forecasts suggest Lake Michigan could rise as much as 2 1/4 feet above its long-term average by May. Its all-time high was recorded in October 1986, when Lake Michigan was more than 3 1/2 feet above the long-term average.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are on the higher-than-normal end, and projections for (2018 indicate) we could be nearing the high from 1986. It's unprecedented,\" said Mark Breederland, an educator for the Michigan Sea Grant. \"When that kind of variation happens, imagine what that does to the shoreline.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The swift rebound from 2013 was aided by elevated Great Lakes ice cover during the polar vortex winters of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, which deterred evaporation. Evaporation was also mitigated during the past two mild winters because peak evaporation occurs when the air temperature is much colder than water temperature.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, a wetter than average October caused lake levels to remain high and prompted experts to revise their estimates for 2018. Every lake saw above-average October precipitation, including lakes Michigan and Huron, which are measured as one body of water and saw 61 percent higher precipitation. The rainfall translated to a lakewide uptick of an inch, which may not seem significant, but is the equivalent of roughly 780 billion gallons of water, Breederland said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lake levels are expected to decline through the winter before climbing again in the spring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The boosted lake levels carry a chance for higher waves and more damage from shoreline erosion as evidenced by a nearly 29-foot wave measured in October by a buoy north of Marquette, Mich., in Lake Superior -- the highest wave on record for any of the Great Lakes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taller waves are a bigger threat to Michigan, where 73 percent of Great Lakes coastal wetlands in the U.S. are located, rather than Illinois, where wetlands are mostly inland. But those areas haven't fared any better. Illinois once had 8 million acres of wetlands but, as it was settled, pioneers dug drainage ditches and used underground pipes to move water to streams and rivers, according to Sullivan, of The Wetlands Initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Essentially 25 percent of the entire surface of Illinois were once wetlands, and now we're in the neighborhood of 90 percent have been lost or converted, mostly because that land was seen more valuable dry than wet,\" Sullivan said. \"A lot of that was for agricultural purposes, but a lot of wetlands have also been degraded, to one extent or another, due to invasive species or dumping.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It wasn't until much later that scientists realized this habitat offered a number of benefits. Besides quickly storing carbon, wetlands also prevent flooding, improve water quality and provide shelter for many wildlife species.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The present-day Sue and Wes Dixon Waterfowl Refuge, a 3,000-acre plot of land southwest of Chicago, was among the native wetlands that had been dried out to grow corn and soybeans. In 2001, The Wetlands Initiative acquired the land and began restoration efforts by halting draining and reintroducing the natural flow of water.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Within a few years, the wetlands saw a swift resurgence in plants and wildlife.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It had not been a lake bed in 100 years,\" Sullivan said. \"It was dry farmland, and it had been hit with all kind of herbicides. But once the water returned to the site, wetland vegetation began springing up all over. This was a seed bank that had been lying dormant for a century, and it was growing back again.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plant life and soil also started to regain the ability to sequester carbon dioxide. In 2007, researchers from UIC studied the restored wetlands and found the habitat had already begun trapping more carbon than area agricultural soils, and it would be sequestering 10 times more by 2040.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It just goes to show you what's possible, if you give nature a chance,\" Sullivan said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>tbriscoe@chicagotribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAPTION: Photo: Lake Michigan water levels, at their highest in 20 years, are predicted to keep climbing into spring, possibly eroding more coastal wetlands.

The agency said coroners are near the area, but it is still unsafe to attend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the slogan \"Canada's hot spot,\" Lytton was well-known as a place that could see warmer temperatures than usual for Canada's west. Nested in a valley, its low elevation also made it particularly dry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even by Lytton's standards, the heat brought to the area by this week's \"heat dome\" of high pressure were unusual, raising new concerns about the unpredictable impact of climate change weather events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sunday, it set a record for top temperature in Canada at 116 degrees. The following day, it broke it again with 118 degrees. On Tuesday, the record went up to 121 degrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around 6 p.m. on Wednesday evening, officials ordered the town evacuated. In total, around 1,000 people in the village and surrounding area were evacuated. Royal Canadian Mounted Police went door to door, telling people it was time to leave, now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our poor little town of Lytton is gone,\" one resident, Edith Loring Kuhanga, wrote Thursday on Facebook. \"This is so devastating \u2014 we are all in shock!

The last weather reading from the station came just a minute later, with temperatures of almost 99 degrees and winds of 42 miles per hour.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lytton's climate nightmare comes amid a wave of hot weather across British Columbia. It is the result of the same \"heat dome\" caused by high pressure \u2014 which forces the heat down rather than allowing it to rise, in turn making the air even hotter \u2014 that has led to record heat in U.S. cities such as Portland and Seattle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lytton had set records for high temperatures for three days in a row \u2014 surpassing the highest temperature ever recorded in Las Vegas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trudeau said on Friday that he would be convening a meeting of his incident response group in the afternoon to address the needs of those communities in British Columbia hit by extreme weather and wildfires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Obviously, today our thoughts are mostly with families that are grieving, facing a terrible loss,\" he told reporters. \"But of course, we also have to recognize the fact that extreme weather events are getting more frequent and climate change has a significant role to play in that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heat may have already had a devastating impact across much of British Columbia, with elderly and other vulnerable residents appearing to have been hit hardest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Columbia's Coroners Service had received reports of 719 sudden and unexpected deaths between June 25 and Thursday , Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said in a statement, three times the usual number.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Founded at the confluence of two major rivers during the Gold Rush, Lytton's economy once revolved around forestry but it is now mainly a destination for white-water rafting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It routinely reports some of the highest temperatures in Canada, due to a combination of dry air and low elevation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polderman told a local radio station this week that he'd hoped the town's \"hot spot\" slogan wouldn't be quite so literal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'd rather be known as Canada's hot spot for education, health care, quality of life than for having the hottest temperatures,\" he said on Wednesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polderman made a quick drive into Lytton on Wednesday night after ordering the evacuation and told CTV News that the town had been \"engulfed\" by flames.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm just hoping that all the residents got out,\" Polderman added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lytton's evacuation came amid a broader swath of wildfires.

The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly, or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unprecedented situation produced by the coronavirus has offered a glimpse at the massive cuts in global emissions, year after year, that would be required to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord. Last fall, a United Nations report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 percent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tuesday's study underscores how far the world remains from that long-term aspiration. The forced plunge in greenhouse gas emissions in recent months, while extraordinary, returned carbon pollution only to levels last seen in 2006. And the changes are unlikely to last.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"History suggests this will be a blip,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus's effect by nation and economic sector. \"The 2008 [financial] crisis decreased global emissions 1.5 percent for one year, and they shot back up 5 percent in 2010. It was like it never happened.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the decline in emissions during the pandemic may have been unprecedented, it was relatively small when it comes to combating global warming. The peak 17 percent decline in global emissions, which occurred in early April, still meant nations continued to generate more than 80 percent of the usual carbon pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers say the experience demonstrates how broad structural changes to the energy system are critical if the world is to slash emissions in a meaningful, sustainable way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We can see now that behavior change alone is not going to do it,\" said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, lead author of the study and director of Britain's Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said she had expected to find even larger reductions in the power and industrial sectors during the pandemic. Instead, she said, many sources of carbon dioxide and other pollutants have continued steadily, almost on autopilot, even as much of the world has ground to a halt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Appliances still run, office buildings must be maintained, and some factories continue to hum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's a lot of inertia in the infrastructure, in the built environment,\" she said. \"It seems like many things are able to function on their own, at least for a short time.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Emissions have fallen before \u2014 during world wars and economic recessions, for instance, and markedly during the Great Depression. But experts do not think the modern world has experienced a plunge so sudden and sharp as in recent months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In absolute terms, it will be the biggest,\" said Glen Peters, one of the study's authors and an expert at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway. \"In relative terms, you will have to go back quite some [time] to find big changes like that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most researchers agree that emissions are all but certain to bounce back once countries reopen. Already, demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and as many U.S. states begin easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than $1 at some pumps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Governments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Where they put this stimulus is really critical,\" Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said. \"It's 2020, and there's not much time to tackle climate change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some world leaders have pledged to push for greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country's effort to slash its emissions remains \"undiminished\" by the coronavirus and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in Parliament, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Inadvertently, the planet this year will [have] greatly reduced its CO2 emissions. \u2026 We need to entrench those gains,\" Johnson told lawmakers. \"I don't want to see us going back to an era of the same type of emissions as we've had in the past. Aviation, like every other sector, must keep its carbon lower.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programs, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection,\" Merkel told a gathering of leaders focused on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new research was conducted by Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, Jackson, Peters and 10 other colleagues affiliated with the Global Carbon Project.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Normally, global emissions are calculated on an annual basis; doing so more rapidly, nearly in real time, presented a scientific challenge. Tuesday's study used a combination of energy data across multiple sectors, as well as data on the strenuousness of lockdowns across 69 countries that account for 97 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, to estimate the reductions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The results varied greatly across different sectors. Airplane emissions plunged by as much as 60 percent \u2014 but airlines represent a relatively small fraction of global emissions. Emissions from surface transportation, one of the largest sources, fell 36 percent at the peak of the shutdowns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Passenger vehicles are down a bit more,\" Jackson said. \"Commercial vehicles and long-haul trucking are down much less. I'm staying at home, but the Amazon delivery vehicle is still driving around.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Emissions linked to home energy use increased about 3 percent, not surprising during a time when people are confined to their homes, using more appliances, lighting, heating and cooling. But industrial electricity demand plummeted, leading to net electricity declines overall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic \u2014 more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips \u2014 individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Unless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't think there's much of a silver lining to covid-19 for the climate,\" he said, \"unless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Podesta, one of two aides who briefed the president that February day. Obama mentioned the images several times as he warned the governors that political leaders had no choice but to cope with global warming's impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After years of putting other policy priorities first -- and dismaying many liberal allies in the process -- Obama is now getting into the weeds on climate change and considers it one of the key components of his legacy, according to aides and advisers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is regularly briefed on scientific reports on the issue, including a national climate assessment that he will help showcase Tuesday. He is using his executive authority to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other sources, and is moving ahead with stricter fuel-efficiency standards for the heaviest trucks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And while he routinely brings up climate change in closed-door meetings with world leaders, according to his aides, he also discusses it in his private life, talking about global warming's implications with his teenage daughters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is really real for him, in terms of what he's leaving,\" said Cecilia Munoz, who directs the White House Domestic Policy Council and has helped coordinate federal investment in climate-resilient infrastructure projects. \"This is personal for him.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a notable transformation for a politician who as a senator talked in grand terms about the need to combat global warming but adopted a much more constrained approach in the run-up to his 2012 reelection. Environmentalists also remain anxious about Obama's delay in making a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, one of the movement's signature issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coal and gas industry officials say they are increasingly alarmed by Obama's focus on climate change, saying administration policies are unrealistic and do not recognize how hydraulic fracturing has transformed the ability to extract oil and gas from the ground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They want a complete transformation from the hydrocarbon molecule to the electron, and their refusal to accept reality continues to frustrate me,\" said Charles T. Drevna, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers. \"So my question is, why are we doing this? Is it because he promised to do it when he came into office? Is it because he's got a large donor out there dangling a lot of money? Is it because he really believes it and is passionate about doing it? Or is it all of the above?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a senator from Illinois, Obama delivered a major speech on climate change, and he described the night he won the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as \"the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\" As president, Obama enacted the first carbon limits for cars and light-duty trucks and helped push through a House bill that would have imposed a national limit on greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that 2009 measure stalled in the Senate, and during his first term the president's top aides were sharply divided on how aggressively to push climate policy at a time when Americans were anxious about the economy, according to several former senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Appointees including Lisa P. Jackson, who served as Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and John P. Holdren, assistant to the president for science and technology, argued that he needed to take the issue on; White House aides such as senior adviser David Axelrod and two chiefs of staff -- Rahm Emanuel and William M. Daley -- considered it a liability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There was a sense then it just wasn't the sort of thing you could tee up in [2011], with an election coming up,\" Daley said in an interview. \"With respect to my friends in the environment community, to put this at the front of the list, you might as well have taken a gun to your head and shot yourself.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, administration officials watched as natural gas production exploded in the United States, providing utilities, manufacturers and other industries with a less-carbon-intense form of energy. Jason Bordoff, senior director for energy and climate change at the National Security Council during the first term, said the president came to embrace an \"all of the above\" energy strategy because he saw the economic benefits associated with natural gas and the role that it could play in bridging the nation's transition to renewable energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't think 'all of the above' is just a slogan,\" said Bordoff, now a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. \"I think it is what people really think is the right policy approach.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even so, Obama has remained wary of some of the risks stemming from hydraulic fracturing, including the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. When the subject of natural gas came up during a Nov. 30, 2012, meeting of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Obama turned to Holdren and his deputy assistant for energy and climate change, Heather Zichal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Do we have an accurate accounting of methane emissions, and do we have a problem there?\" Zichal recalled the president asking. The White House announced a new methane strategy -- which will include additional federal regulations -- in March.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Sandy also helped convince Obama that the United States needs to rethink the way it rebuilds after disasters, aides said. Coal industry officials, such as the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, Robert \"Mike\" Duncan, said that approach is misguided and aims to drum up support for more-aggressive climate regulations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He's spending money, in my view, in the wrong place,\" Duncan said in an interview. \"He needs to be focused on the economy, and the balance has gotten out of hand.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the president -- who recognizes that global warming ranks as a low priority among voters -- the issue has become as much about evangelizing as rulemaking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After his reelection, Obama told chief speechwriter Jon Favreau to make climate change \"one of the big sections\" in his second inaugural address, Favreau recalled. The move surprised even some of his closest aides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Delivering on that promise of action -- through the EPA's upcoming rule to curb carbon emissions from existing power plants -- will spark a political and legal fight, but even some top utility executives say they think they will be able to live with the proposal the EPA will issue in June. Thomas F. Farrell, chief executive of Dominion Resources, said the agency showed flexibility when it imposed limits on mercury in 2011 and appears poised to do so again.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't set the rules, but we think it's our job to let the people setting the rules know what their impact will be,\" Farrell said. \"I think they have been listening to that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Obama still faces the risk of opposition from his left flank. Environmentalists such as Democratic donor and billionaire Tom Steyer want him to veto the Keystone pipeline and wean the nation from natural gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke said of the administration: \"We have to increasingly get them to acknowledge that there has to be a major transformation away from fossil fuels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House has stayed out of the State Department's review of the pipeline project, according to current and former senior administration officials, though Obama has been briefed on the issue. Top White House aides signed off on the move last month to postpone a decision until after a legal battle over the pipeline's Nebraska route is resolved.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, Obama is pressing the case for carbon cuts abroad as well as domestically. In his recent bilateral discussions with the leaders of Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, the president spent significant time talking about climate, according to aides. He raised concerns with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye about their financing of coal-fired plants in the developing world, aides said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Tuesday, the White House's reinvigorated strategy will be on full display. Back in June 2009, the administration's low-key launch of its second national climate assessment received only a smattering of coverage from regional papers. This time, Obama will conduct interviews from the White House with local and national TV meteorologists, who will also be briefed by senior administration officials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Podesta said Americans will be more willing to embrace meaningful limits on carbon emissions once they recognize their impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They're going to feel risks in their own lives, and then they will be willing to act,\" Podesta said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>juliet.eilperin@washpost.com\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

The effort builds, to a large extent, on studies aiming to create a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for the world\u2019s nations \u2014 divvying up the amount of emissions (and thus fuels) below that threshold. The most notable paper, published in Nature, was\u00a0\u201cGreenhouse-Gas Emission Targets for Limiting Global Warming to 2\u2009\u00b0C.\u201d (2\u2009\u00b0C being 2 degrees Celsius).

The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that excessive heat caused by climate change could kill more than 150,000 Americans by the end of the century in the 40 largest cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAs carbon pollution continues to rise, the number of dangerously hot days each summer will increase even further, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of lives lost,\u201d the council reported.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Extreme heat claims an average of 117 lives each year, but the real incidence is likely far higher. In addition, about 1,800 people die from illnesses made worse by heat, the council estimates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cDeath rates from many causes rise during heat waves that are related to heat but not reported as such,\u201d said Dr. Christopher B. Colwell, director of emergency medicine at Denver Health Medical Center. \u201cLots of deaths that occur during heat waves are attributed to natural causes like heart attacks, kidney disease or respiratory disease.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Especially at risk are the elderly, young children, athletes of all ages and weekend warriors whose bodies are not adapted to heat stress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAs common as the problem is, it\u2019s not common enough to grab people\u2019s attention until it hits close to home,\u201d Dr. Colwell said in an interview.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even a high-profile death, like that of Korey Stringer, 27, a Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle who suffered heatstroke after a summer morning practice in 2001, has not prompted all coaches to take necessary precautions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cMany coaches have held practices in the heat for years and no one died, so they think a bigger deal is being made of the problem than it really is,\u201d Dr. Colwell said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the six years before Stringer\u2019s death, 19 high school and college players died from heatstroke, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina. Too often, a player suffering from heat exhaustion, the first stage of a potentially life-threatening heat illness, is sent back on the field after a brief rest instead of being benched for the day or longer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While deaths of healthy young athletes tend to be well publicized, the elderly are much more likely to succumb to extreme heat. Dr. Colwell explained that with age, the body\u2019s ability to cool itself declines. Among other changes, blood vessels don\u2019t dilate as readily to allow heat to escape, a problem made worse by conditions like congestive heart failure and peripheral vascular disease.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many older people without air-conditioning or fans may not know when to get out of the heat, or they may be physically unable to leave an overheated dwelling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dehydration, a common problem among the elderly as well as among younger people who exercise strenuously, raises the risk of heat illness by diminishing the body\u2019s ability to lose heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Medications taken by many older people also increase their vulnerability to heat stress, among them beta blockers prescribed for high blood pressure and anticholinergics used to treat lung problems and urinary incontinence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other drugs, too, can contribute to a hypersensitivity to heat, including lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines and antispasmodics. Recreational drugs, like cocaine, amphetamines, PCP and alcohol, can be a problem as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heat illness often occurs several days into a heat wave, as the effects on the body accumulate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The body normally operates within a rather narrow temperature range. If body temperature rises above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, enzymes begin to break down and normal metabolic processes are disrupted. When Stringer collapsed, his temperature registered above 108 degrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heat radiates from the body when blood vessels are maximally dilated and the air temperature is lower than body temperature. But the most effective natural coolant is sweat; as it collects on the skin and evaporates, it draws heat from the body.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The risk of heat illness rises with the heat index, a combined measure of air temperature and relative humidity. When the humidity is high (or too much clothing is worn), sweat simply rolls off the skin without evaporating and cooling it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coaches, take note: depending on athletes\u2019 ages, intensity of activity and degree of acclimatization, you should consider canceling practice and games when the heat index exceeds 105, experts say. City dwellers are most at risk during heat waves because paved surfaces, tall buildings and minimal tree cover enhance heat absorption, creating a \u201cheat island.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heat illness is a form of hyperthermia, defined as a rise in core body temperature. But it does not respond to fever-reducing medications, making it extremely important to recognize heat exhaustion, an early sign of trouble. Common complaints include fatigue, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea and muscle cramps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Colwell explained that the brain\u2019s cerebellum is especially sensitive to heat, which explains the early signs of a heatstroke: unsteady gait, confusion and disorientation. Heatstroke, characterized by a rise in body temperature above 104 degrees, has a death rate as high as 50 percent. Symptoms typically include a change in mental status, like delirium, seizures or even coma.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the elderly, heatstroke most often develops gradually, over several hot days. But among otherwise healthy people engaged in strenuous exercise, it tends to occur suddenly, within minutes to hours, which demands particular attention to early symptoms.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Jerry Brown's plan to provide urgently needed new funding for California's bullet train project from corporate fees on greenhouse gases melds two of his political passions: building the nation's first, truly high-speed rail system and putting the state at the forefront of the battle against global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bullet train system suffered a series of legal blows last year that blocked $9 billion in state funding, sending Brown and his allies on a search for a new source of funds. This week, Brown plans to announce a new strategy to keep the project moving: dipping into hundreds of millions of dollars in fees collected from businesses whose carbon dioxide emissions exceed state limits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he may be trading one set of legal and political problems for another.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The thought of tapping those so-called cap-and-trade funds to support the $68-billion rail line is generating opposition from powerful environmental groups that have in the past allied themselves with the governor, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Planning and Conservation League.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The electrically powered bullet train has been marketed by the state rail agency as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from California's vast transportation system. But those benefits may not be realized for many years and environmentalists would prefer the funds go to projects that can have larger immediate effects on what they consider an urgent climate crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The high-speed rail board is trying to make the best of a troubled situation, but I don't think raiding cap-and-trade is the right direction to go,\" said Bruce Reznik, executive director of the Planning and Conservation League.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The planned bullet train system's needs are so vast it could become a \"money pit,\" Reznik said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brown's new funding plan would offer a short-term but important solution to the bullet train's financial problems but leaves many crucial, longer-term issues murky.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As part of Brown's budget proposal to the Legislature scheduled to be announced Friday, the state would use $250 million of cap-and-trade revenue for the project, according to Capitol officials with knowledge of the plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state is relying on federal grants for its funding, though under current agreements it will have to begin matching that spending with state dollars sometime this year. The rail authority did not respond to a request to clarify when it will have to legally match the federal funds, though legislative sources say it could be as early as this spring. The state budget goes into effect July 1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state is in effect betting that court rulings would permit it to use voter-approved bond funds at a later time, and that billions of dollars in additional federal grants would become available in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there would be significant legal risks. The state law that set up the limits on greenhouse gases and the cap-and-trade system calls for investments that will reduce emissions by 2020 to the levels that existed in 1990, some experts say. The state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office, noting the bullet train would not be in operation until after 2020, has questioned the legality of using the cap-and-trade funding for rail construction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) was reserved in his response to the governor's proposal, calling for \"a very robust legal analysis\" of using cap-and-trade money for the bullet train.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've never believed you have to show definitively where every dollar is for the entire build-out,\" Steinberg said. \"Having said that, I do think this proposal needs to be analyzed within the framework of: What is the overall strategy for the next leg?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Within that context, cap-and-trade may or may not be the right funding source.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental groups have supported the bullet train project, arguing it could reduce highway construction, allow more compact cities and help wean the public off dependence on fossil fuel. But they have objected to the route's effect on sensitive environments, as well as the governor's previous suggestion that the rail project be exempt from some requirements under state environmental law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokeswoman for the California High-Speed Rail Authority said the proposed use of cap-and-trade funding is not new and has been included in a list of possible projects by the state Air Resources Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dave Clegern, spokesman for the air board, dismissed legal concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a pretty good legal department, and they vet these things very carefully,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bullet train's funding problems multiplied six weeks ago when Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny ruled the state failed to comply with voter-approved restrictions in a 2008 bond measure. The measure required the state to produce a funding plan that identifies the sources of money to complete an initial operational segment of the rail line. Under current plans, that segment would run from Merced to the San Fernando Valley and cost $31 billion. But the state has only about $12 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Separately, Kenny refused to validate the sale of the bonds, stalling the state's ability to draw on $9 billion in funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dan Richard, chairman of the rail authority board, has characterized the judge's rulings as manageable setbacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We believe that we have a number of different ways to satisfy the judge's concern,\" Richard wrote in an email last month to reporters. He hasn't indicated how his agency plans to do that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to seeking cap-and-trade money, the state could request additional changes to its federal funding agreement, pushing back the date when the state would have to begin matching federal funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, the rail agency has not run short of money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We continue to get paid and be assured that we will get paid in the future,\" said Ron Tutor, chairman of Tutor Perini Corp., the construction firm that won a $1-billion contract last year to build an initial 29-mile segment of rail. Tutor has said he expects to begin construction by July 1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cap-and-trade already is facing a legal challenge from the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which argues the program is an unconstitutional tax that was not properly authorized by the Legislature.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James Burling, the organizations' director of litigation, said Brown's new proposal also is legally problematic. \"It's a desperate attempt by the governor to grab money for his pet project,\" Burling said. \"It continues to demonstrate why [the cap-and-trade law] is unconstitutional and why the railroad makes no sense.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ralph.vartabedian@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>chris.megerian@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC: MAP: California; CREDIT:Los Angeles Times\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 10}

It\u2019s harder to determine how many terrestrial species vanished, but the loss was comparable. </p>\n<p>This mass extinction, at the end of the Permian Period, was the worst in the planet\u2019s history, and it happened over a few thousand years at most \u2014 the blink of a geological eye. </p>\n<p>On Thursday, a team of scientists offered a detailed accounting of how marine life was wiped out during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Global warming robbed the oceans of oxygen, they say, putting many species under so much stress that they died off. </p>\n<p>And we may be repeating the process, the scientists warn. If so, then climate change is \u201csolidly in the category of a catastrophic extinction event,\u201d said Curtis Deutsch, an earth scientist at the University of Washington and co-author of the new study, published in the journal Science.</p>\n<p>Researchers have long known the general outlines of Permian-Triassic cataclysm. Just before the extinctions, volcanoes in what is now Siberia erupted on a tremendous scale. The magma and lava that they belched forth produced huge amounts of carbon dioxide. </p>\n<p>Once in the atmosphere, the gas trapped heat. Researchers estimate that the surface of the ocean warmed by about 18 degrees Fahrenheit. Some researchers argue that the heat alone killed off many species. </p>\n<p>Others believe that the warmth reduced oxygen in the ocean, asphyxiating the species living there. Rocks from the mass extinction appear to have formed when at least some of the ocean was lacking oxygen.</p>\n<p>In previous research, Dr. Deutsch has explored how living animals adapt to temperature and oxygen levels in the seas. Animals with a fast metabolism need a lot of oxygen, for example, and so they can\u2019t live in parts of the ocean where oxygen falls below a certain threshold. </p>\n<p>Warm water makes the challenge even more difficult. Warmer water can\u2019t hold as much dissolved oxygen as cold water. Even worse, warm water can also increase an animal\u2019s metabolism, meaning it requires more oxygen just to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Cod, for example, are not found below a latitude running roughly from New England to Spain. South of that line, warmth and low oxygen are just too great for the species.</p>\n<p>Dr. Deutsch and Justin Penn, a graduate student, recreated the world at the end of the Permian Period with a large-scale computer simulation, complete with a heat-trapping atmosphere and a circulating ocean.</p>\n<p>As the Siberian volcanoes flooded the virtual atmosphere with carbon dioxide, the atmosphere warmed. The ocean warmed, too \u2014 and according to the model, it began losing oxygen.</p>\n<p>Some parts lost more than others. On the surface, for example, fresh oxygen was produced by photosynthetic algae. But as the ocean warmed, its circulatory currents also slowed, the model demonstrated. </p>\n<p>Oxygen-poor water settled to the bottom of the oceans, and before long, the deep was gasping. </p>\n<p>Rising temperatures and plunging oxygen must have made huge swaths of the oceans uninhabitable. Some species survived here and there. But most disappeared completely. </p>\n<p>\u201cEverything was losing a lot of habitat, creating the risk of extinction,\u201d said Dr. Deutsch. \u201cBut the risk was actually higher in places that were cold. That was a bit surprising.\u201d</p>\n<p>You might expect that animals near the Equator would be at a greater risk, because the water was warm to begin with. But Dr. Deutsch\u2019s model suggested a very different kind of apocalypse. </p>\n<p>Animals in oxygen-rich cold water could not handle the sudden drop, while those in tropical waters were already adapted to poor oxygen. And the cold-water species could not find refuge elsewhere. </p>\n<p>To test their simulation, the researchers teamed up with Jonathan Payne and Erik Sperling, paleontologists at Stanford University. They dug into a huge online database of fossils to chart the risks of extinction at different latitudes during the catastrophe. </p>\n<p>When they were done with their analysis, they sent their graph to Seattle. Dr. Deutsch and Mr. Penn compared it to the prediction from their computer model. </p>\n<p>They matched. \u201cThis was the most exciting moment of my scientific life,\u201d said Dr. Deutsch.</p>\n<p>Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the study, said that it resolved the roles of heat and oxygen as causes of the mass extinction. \u201cThis makes a clear case that, of course, the two are linked,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p><em class=\"bold\">[</em><em class=\"bold\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em><em class=\"bold\"> </em><em>| Sign up for the </em><em class=\"bold\">Science Times newsletter.</em><em class=\"bold\">]</em></p>\n<p>The new study offers an important warning to humans over the next few centuries. </p>\n<p>The Siberian volcanoes ultimately delivered much more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than we will ever emit by burning fossil fuels. But our annual rate of carbon emissions is actually higher.</p>\n<p>The carbon we released over the past two centuries already has made the atmosphere warmer, and the ocean has absorbed much of that heat. And now, just as during the Permian-Triassic extinction, the ocean is losing oxygen. Over the past fifty years, oxygen levels have declined by 2 percent. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe way the Earth system is responding now to the buildup of CO2 is in the exact same way that we\u2019ve seen it respond in the past,\u201d said Lee Kump, a geoscientist at Penn State University. </p>\n<p>Just how much warmer the planet will get is up to us. It will take a tremendous international effort to keep the increase below about 4 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>\n<p>If we proceed to use up all the fossil fuels on Earth, it could warm by as much as 17 degrees Fahrenheit by 2300. </p>\n<p>As the ocean warms, its oxygen levels will continue to drop. If ancient history is any guide, the consequences for life \u2014 especially marine life in the cooler parts of the ocean \u2014 will be disastrous.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeft unchecked, climate warming is putting our future on the same scale as some of the worst events in geological history,\u201d Dr. Deutsch said.</p></body></html></p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

The NHL. Climate change. I had to call the league.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I found Mitchell. He explained from Foxborough, Mass., the site of the league's New Year's Day Winter Classic, after giving U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy a tour of the league's game-day setup. The NHL and the EPA. Really?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's my conversation with Mitchell:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was an NHL vice president doing in Paris last month speaking at a forum tangentially connected to the historic U.N. climate change summit?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our game, which is probably unique to most other professional sports, is so tied to the environment. We need cold weather; we need fresh water to play. Therefore, our game is directly impacted by climate change and fresh water scarcity. So we developed NHL Green, a mandate to promote this type of awareness across all of our organizations. Over the course of the last five years, we've done everything from a food recovery initiative, which was taking all the unused food that we prepare in our arenas and donating it to local food banks ... to a water restoration program. All of that culminated in the release of a sustainability report in 2014, which was the first of its kind from any U.S. pro sports league. It's important to us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What does the league hope to do? Reduce its carbon footprint or to get global neighbors to reduce theirs?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Right now it's an internal focus. To show what we're doing internally can show carbon reductions. About 75 percent of our carbon emissions came from electricity use. That's typically energy consumption in NHL arenas. So if you want to target how to reduce power environmental impact, you have to start there, reduce energy consumption in our buildings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does the league have any goals or benchmarks?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We did not establish goals because we're just in the first phase of a much longer process. The first part is understanding where we are. That's what this first sustainability report was. Understanding what our footprint is before we can understand what tangible goals we can set.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What involvement is there of individual owners, coaches or players in this effort?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of the players are interested. One that comes to mind immediately is (Oilers defenseman) Andrew Ference. He's a self-proclaimed eco-athlete. He prioritizes this in his life. So he's a big environmental champion. Our next stage is to engage more players around this issue. When we put out stuff on our social media platforms, with 12 million followers, that definitely gets messaging out to fans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Have you seen any loss in the frozen pond environment?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are in touch with a university in Canada (Wilfrid Laurier University) that is doing a study called RinkWatch. What they are doing is (getting) folks who play on frozen ponds to record the conditions in their local ponds, and that way we can get crowd-source information. Then there's a historical record of that and they can build a database.

But this year, the state saw record evaporation and record low runoff into streams and reservoirs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is \"unprecedented in the breadth and severity of this regional drought,\" said Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the state's Natural Resources Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, fire officials in Southern California warned that wildfire conditions are already like those typically seen in August and September.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're seeing fires move fast,\" said Chief Brian Fennessy of the Orange County Fire Authority. \"Fires that normally would be an acre, 2 acres, 5 acres, so far this year are getting to 30, 50 and beyond.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They're also spreading more quickly, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are seeing fire spread that is even stunning many of us that have been doing this for a very long time -- fire spread that could quite easily surprise many of the citizens within this region,\" he said. He urged people to evacuate as soon as they're told to do so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These dry conditions do not bode well for the Fourth of July weekend, when first responders will probably face their first big test as a predicted heat wave collides with amateur fireworks displays.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded a drought emergency to 41 California counties, covering 30% of the state's population. On Friday, Santa Clara County declared its own local emergency, saying drought conditions were so extreme that water levels were not adequate to meet demand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The reality is we live in an arid region that will continue to experience droughts,\" Jasneet Sharma, director of Santa Clara County's Office of Sustainability, said in a statement. \"There are many steps that we should all take, from large-scale conservation projects and household- level water conservation retrofits to simple household changes like turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth. Each one is an important part of sustainability.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Water conservation is likely to ramp up, possibly becoming mandatory in some communities, said Joaquin Esquivel, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's not about conservation just because it's drought. ... We really need to see conservation and efficiency here as just [a] simple course of action that we must do, no matter if it's dry or it's wet,\" Esquivel said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year's parched conditions are already causing concern, especially after a heat wave swept across Southern California this month, breaking several records and heating Palm Springs to 123 degrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Usually the natural world can adapt to gradual changes in the climate, but California's conditions are changing so frequently that plants and animals are not able to keep up, said Chuck Bonham, director of California's Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They don't have the luxury of adapting over millennia anymore; they're being forced to adapt over a period of years,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decrease in water levels has caused some rivers to heat up, becoming uninhabitable for some fish. Department of Fish and Wildlife teams recently removed almost 17 million Chinook salmon from four hatcheries in the Central Valley and released them into the ocean at places such as San Francisco Bay. The number of fish rescues has increased since the previous drought, Bonham said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We also know we're going to end up serving as a Noah's Ark,\" he added, referring to a menagerie of animals kept at UC Davis until their environments become cool enough to live in again. \"Every drop of water we can save as Californians is going to matter for people, but it's going to matter for nature too.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The drying also carries severe consequences for wildfire.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, fire officials gathered outside a Los Angeles County fire station in La Canada Flintridge and said the heightened fire conditions were due to drought and unseasonably warm temperatures. Scientists say that climate change has driven the shifts by creating hotter, drier weather interspersed with more extreme, erratic precipitation events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Live fuel moisture levels, which measure the dryness of vegetation, are on par with those typically seen in the late summer or fall, said Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby, who serves as mutual aid coordinator for the region comprising Los Angeles, Orange, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You saw the fire in L.A. city, the Palisades fire that burned in the fog,\" he said, referring to the blaze that forced evacuations in Topanga Canyon in mid-May. \"That's kind of unprecedented, you would think in years past, but it's the norm now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fire broke out in an area that hadn't burned in 50 years and that was choked with drought-killed vegetation, he said. Because of the topography and dryness, it grew to more than 1,000 acres before firefighters were able to bring it under control, despite relatively calm winds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our expectations are that during this summer, we're going to have those types of fires and larger with just the winds off the ocean,\" Osby said. \"And then we're really concerned moving into the fall months when we start getting our significant wind-driven fires.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Officials have taken steps to prepare. When the forecast looks dire -- for instance, if the National Weather Service issues a red-flag warning -- the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services works with local jurisdictions to pre-position extra firefighters, engines and aircraft and reimburses the governments for the added cost, said Cal OES Fire and Rescue Chief Brian Marshall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That gives us a fighting chance to catch the fires when they're small,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Key to that is the prompt use of aircraft, which enables ground crews to then go in and extinguish the fires, Fennessy said. Southern California fire personnel have more aircraft available this year than in years past, including large helitankers that can fly at night, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection moved to peak staffing earlier this year, sooner than normal, and will maintain that level for the rest of the year, said Chief Glenn Barley, assistant region chief for Cal Fire's Southern Region.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Last year was the worst fire season we've seen in California,\" Barley said. \"At this point this year, we are ahead of those numbers for last year, both in terms of number of fires and number of acres burned.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet fire officials said that while they're well resourced, they still don't have enough, particularly in light of the potentially historic fire season bearing down on the region.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I will say that from my municipality to the state to the federal government, that we're stretched. We're busy,\" Osby said, adding that local municipalities still have to go on medical calls -- more than 1,000 a day in the case of his department -- in addition to fighting fires. \"None of us have all the resources that we need.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said L.A. County would normally have 24 inmate firefighting crews but is down to eight, as many were sent home from prison after the state granted them early release because of the pandemic. That has forced the department to dip into its budget to train more paid crew members, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the National Interagency Fire Center this week raised its preparedness level to 4, the second-highest, said Angeles National Forest Fire Chief Robert Garcia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The significance of that is that the last time we were in this preparedness Level 4 at this time of year was in 2002,\" he said. \"And prior to that, the last time was 1991.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: HOUSEBOATS are dwarfed by the steep, dry banks of drought-parched Lake Oroville, whose water level had dropped to 42% of capacity by April.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Justin Sullivan Getty Images</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO:CATTLE RANCHER John Guthrie at a reservoir with no water in Porterville, Calif., in Tulare County.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Gary Coronado Los Angeles Times\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 13}

Even when its rivals had backed away from the fossil fuel, Glencore continued to double down, \nlast year scooping up Australian assets\nfrom Rio Tinto PLC for $1.7 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Anglo-Swiss commodity trader said Wednesday it plans to limit its annual coal production at 150 million metric tons, toward the higher end of its target range this year, as it moves to align itself with evolving views on global warming. While that's more than Glencore's production of recent years\u2014last year, the company produced 130 million metric tons of coal\u2014its recent acquisitions indicated it likely had larger aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the world's biggest cheerleaders for coal in recent years is Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Glasenberg took control of the firm's world-wide coal business in 1990 and spearheaded its dominant position in coal mining, snapping up operations in Colombia, South Africa and Australia. After Glencore completed its \npurchase of mining behemoth\nXstrata PLC in 2013, the largest mining deal ever, Mr. Glasenberg said the deal was \"a big play\" on coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coal prices collapsed soon after, however, leaving investors wondering if Mr. Glasenberg, seen as one of the mining industry's most astute deal makers, had made a mistake. But prices more recently have surged, making coal among Glencore's most profitable commodities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Glasenberg doesn't expect that to change soon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The coal market is extremely strong,\" he said on an August earnings call. \"It's all holding well for coal going forward.\" On Wednesday, the CEO said he expects demand for thermal coal in Southeast Asia and elsewhere to remain robust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world's corporate giants are under growing pressure to shift away from fossil fuels that are blamed for contributing to climate change. Investor groups are pushing companies to invest in cleaner fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glencore's decision to limit coal production is exactly the kind of step investors have encouraged companies to make in order to avoid potentially more damaging impacts as the world moves to lower-carbon energy forms, said Anne Simpson, director of board governance and strategy at the California Public Employees' Retirement System. Ms. Simpson has played a central role in climate-related discussions with global companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We want to make the shift from coal deliberate and strategic rather than waiting for the chaos of a market transition without any guardrails,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glencore is the latest company to agree to the investor demands, but many more are likely to follow as companies prepare for their annual meetings of shareholders in the coming months. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Europe's largest oil-and-gas company, agreed in December to set targets to reduce the emissions from the use of its products, the first giant energy company to agree to such a step.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the world's largest Western oil companies, Shell is moving most aggressively to a future focused on natural gas, a strategy that has smoothed the path for its strident climate goals, since natural gas accounts for far lower emissions than crude and related products. None have taken steps to limit oil production, but BP PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and France's Total SA have all set various goals to reduce certain kinds of emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>BP has committed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations, and Chevron has moved to lower methane emissions and flaring. Both companies have tied the goals to compensation for employees. Total has made numerous investments in alternative sources of energy, along with Shell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon has also supported methane reduction and has given its financial backing to a U.S. lobbying effort to enact a carbon tax. BP, Shell and Total all support the measure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>BHP Group Ltd., a big producer of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, last year left the coal industry's lobbying group, the World Coal Association, due to differences over their approach to climate change. Glencore and Anglo American PLC, another big coal producer, remain members of the association. Anglo several years ago said it planned to sharply reduce its coal assets but reversed course after coal prices surged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite mounting concerns about coal, it remains the \nworld's largest source of electricity\n, according to the International Energy Agency. Countries in Asia and Africa are expected to increase their use of coal to expand power generation through 2040, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glencore also Wednesday launched a $2 billion share-buyback program that is set to run until the end of 2019. The company's share price was trading 1.6% higher in the London afternoon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wednesday's announcement represents \"peak coal\" for Glencore, said the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a nonprofit that supports ethical investments. It is \"an extraordinary about-face,\" said Dan Gocher, the ACCR's director of climate and environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glencore had long been a holdout on coal. The company has said its thermal coal was a cheap source of power-plant fuel for emerging economies. Mr. Glasenberg has said strong demand for low-cost energy in Southeast Asia, combined with underinvestment in new coal assets, would drive prices higher for years to come.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glencore on Wednesday also reported a 41% decline in net profit to $3.41 billion for 2018 after booking impairments at two of its mines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Revenue for the year rose 6.9% to $219.75 billion, Glencore said. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\u2014which strips out one-off items\u2014rose to $15.77 billion, from $14.55 billion in 2017. A consensus estimate from 20 analysts compiled by Vuma projected adjusted Ebitda of $16.14 billion for the full year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glencore also said it would \ncut copper production at its Mutanda operation in Congo\nto about 100,000 metric tons from its recent average of about 200,000 tons a year as it explores new mining methods. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Glencore would cut production at Mutanda. The move will have little effect on cobalt production, the company said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The company said it expects production levels across all of its commodities in 2019 to be higher than last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neanda Salvaterra and Bradley Olson contributed to this article.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Scott Patterson at \nscott.patterson@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Scott Patterson and Oliver Griffin\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

Results of the auction, including prices and volume, will be made public Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists, who had been working years on the market-based approach to curbing global warming, called the auction an important step.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The launch of the nation's first economy-wide carbon market emphasizes once again California's leadership in developing innovative energy policies,\" said Alex Jackson, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sale of these pollution credits is a key part of a six-year state effort to curb and reduce to 1990 levels the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in California by the year 2020.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polluters initially get 90% of their needed credits free, but they are required to buy more if they plan to release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases above allotted levels.

But the timing of his trip means \"L.A. is well-positioned\" to host such an event, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama last week committed the U.S. to cutting net greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% by 2025. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, announced an accelerated time frame for capping carbon emissions and increasing China's use of nuclear, wind and solar energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Limiting carbon emissions in large part means controlling emissions in cities, Garcetti said. Given Los Angeles' track record in tackling its smog problem, \"it's kind of a no-brainer to do [the summit] in L.A. ... Cities are the source of the problem and must be the solution,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Timing and other details of the proposed gathering have yet to be discussed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The environment was a core part of Garcetti's China trip; in Shenzhen, the mayor joined in a ribbon-cutting for the new China headquarters of SaveSorb, an L.A.-based company that produces a natural absorbent for oil, paint and fuel spills. In Beijing, the mayor delivered a speech on urbanization and sustainability at the Stanford Center at Peking University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Courting tourists was also high on the agenda. Los Angeles welcomed 570,000 Chinese visitors last year, making it the top U.S. destination for Chinese tourists. Garcetti says he aims to raise that to 1 million annually within a few years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five Los Angeles medical centers -- UCLA, Keck Hospital of USC, Cedars-Sinai, City of Hope and Children's Hospital -- are hoping to persuade more Chinese tourists to seek health exams and other services while in Southern California. The hospitals have launched a partnership with China Southern Airlines, with the carrier offering itineraries that combine full-day health scans at the L.A. medical centers with visits to sites such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A lot of Chinese media asked me: Is this for plastic surgery? Because you're in Hollywood,\" Garcetti laughed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mayor participated in two Discover L.A. receptions and sat for an interview with Internet portal Youku, during which he played the piano and chatted about places to visit in L.A. beyond well-known destinations such as Universal Studios.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's a hunger for authenticity, not just going to the big, check-the-box-off theme parks.

interview, the French president sought to reassure a country buffeted by rising inflation, scorching temperatures and uncertain political waters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PARIS \u2014 In his first televised interview since his re-election, President Emmanuel Macron of France adopted a combative tone on Thursday in trying to reassure the French that he was firmly at the wheel to address challenges ranging from inflation to climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Following a laborious start to his second term that had fueled worries that listlessness was gripping the presidency, Mr. Macron rejected the idea that the country was headed for five years of \u201cimmobilism\u201d after he lost his absolute majority last month in the lower house of Parliament.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said, before smiling at the two journalists from the TF1 and France 2 television channels who were interviewing him on the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace\u2019s lawn, and adding: \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard what I\u2019ve been saying for the past hour!\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Macron, appearing energetic, had said a lot \u2014 on French military spending and rising inflation in the context of the war in Ukraine, on the need to tackle climate change as France tries to cope with wildfires and a sweltering heat wave, and on his vow to reform the French labor market and pension system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI want the country to move forward,\u201d Mr. Macron said in the Bastille Day interview. \u201cI will do everything to find intelligent compromises along that course.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since taking office in 2017, Mr. Macron had broken with the widely observed presidential tradition of Bastille Day televised interviews, giving only one previously, in 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His decision to return to tradition on Thursday suggested he was eager to shore up support and to give France a sense of direction that had been lacking over the past few months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One survey published this week by the Ifop polling institute found that his approval rating, which has declined since his election, was at 37 percent, his lowest since the start of the pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Macron convincingly defeated Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader, to win a second term in April, but a poor performance by his party and his center-right allies in the parliamentary elections, attributed by some analysts partly to his lack of involvement in the campaign, raised questions about his ability to govern.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Macron added to concerns that he was adrift when he belatedly appointed a new prime minister and a new government, only to tweak his cabinet again earlier this month, seeking a fresh start that seemed to elude him as a string of international summits and diplomatic overtures to stop fighting in Ukraine kept him away from France.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Macron said on Thursday that he was confident that his government could find compromise and pass legislation, arguing that only a \u201cbaroque combination\u201d of parties that are \u201ccompletely opposed to each other\u201d \u2014 a left-wing coalition, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, and mainstream conservatives \u2014 could muster enough votes to thwart him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that was precisely what happened this week, when opposition lawmakers rejected a proposal giving the government the ability to reinstate Covid-19 health passes at France\u2019s borders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill is not final \u2014 it will go to the Senate and can still be tweaked \u2014 but the developments were a worrying setback for the government, and an ominous sign as it hopes to pass a bill on purchasing power over the summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Macron\u2019s interview came after a Bastille Day military parade in Paris that opened with the presentation of the flags of guest countries, most of them Eastern European allies like Estonia, Poland and Romania, and was followed by troops representing French forces currently deployed on NATO\u2019s eastern flank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis war is going to last, but France will always be in a position to help Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Macron said, as he accused Russia of wielding energy as a weapon and said that there was a \u201clikely risk\u201d that the country would cut gas flows to Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult scenario and we must prepare for it,\u201d he added, although he noted that France, which draws about 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, was not as dependent on Russian gas as some of its neighbors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Macron warned that the economic impact of the war would become more acute in the fall and the winter, and he said the government would draw up plans to save energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he also said that his reformist zeal was intact, announcing that the government would work on reforming France\u2019s unemployment system in the fall to address labor shortages. He also repeated his vow to gradually raise the legal age of retirement to 65, up from 62, starting in 2023.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents have accused Mr. Macron of extolling the virtues of compromise without showing any appetite for it himself \u2014 especially on the left, where his pro-business agenda, which would not impose higher taxes on the rich, has been widely rejected and is seen as more compatible with the right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHis outstretched hand does not extend to us,\u201d Olivier Faure, the head of the Socialist Party, said on Twitter.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Biden mused at one point about how appealing the proposals might have been to his father and asked senators to keep in mind people like his old neighbors in Scranton, Pa., as they consider the legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This president makes an incredibly compelling case that this is the moment to go big,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \"This is a moment you have to be able to deliver real money in the pockets of Americans that are hurting.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's salesmanship opened a new chapter in a complicated battle over his infrastructure agenda. White House and Democratic leaders are juggling an ideologically diverse caucus that must remain unified to push the massive spending package to Biden's desk. This comes as senators are working on a separate but related bipartisan infrastructure deal, raising the prospect that Republican votes could peel off from that effort as Democrats push for trillions in new social spending.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, Biden made the pitch for both bills. And after spending nearly an hour with Democratic senators, the president \u2014 who served in the Senate for 36 years \u2014 told reporters it was \"great to be home, great to be back with all my colleagues, and I think we're going to get a lot done.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than a half-dozen Democratic senators spoke during the lunch that had a \"pep rally\" feel, said one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting. Rather than asking questions of Biden, Senate Democrats thanked the president for his ambitious agenda and other members for building the plans on Capitol Hill to execute it. In particular, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 a rival during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries \u2014 praised Biden for putting forward a plan to help people who need it the most, the official said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agreeing on the size of the resolution produced Wednesday's positive atmosphere, but a long process lies ahead: Many of the party's most ambitious spending ideas have yet to be translated into actual policies. On thorny issues like health care, immigration, climate change and taxes, the debate easily could take months and antagonize existing political fissures within the Democratic caucus, souring the current mood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators urged their colleagues to keep the momentum in the coming months as lawmakers hash out the details.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"[Biden] essentially said, this is a big moment: We are on the verge of actually delivering meaningful help to hundreds of millions of middle-class Americans,\" said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.). \"He went through a couple of concrete and specific ways it would make a real difference for families.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats were further animated by the political promise embedded in a set of agenda items supported by a president who has promised to focus on working Americans and make the government responsive to their everyday concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He understands people who work really hard who don't get special breaks all the time, and I think that has the potential to be transformational to our politics,\" said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.). \"The Democratic Party is on the cusp of making it clear again why the middle class should support them, because we're going to do things that they feel, that's not esoteric.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only after Biden left did any Senate Democrat offer critical feedback. That came from Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), who has not been shy about using his leverage as a moderate from an overwhelmingly Republican state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Manchin expressed a general willingness to work with his fellow Democrats on the massive bill, and he did not raise concerns with its size and scope, but he shared uneasiness with some of the policies that could be embedded in it \u2014 such as an ambitious goal of \"decarbonizing\" American energy production by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and encouraging more renewable sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You cannot be moving towards eliminating fossil [fuels] \u2014 you should be innovating and using more technology,\" said Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \"They know where I stand, and we're going to sit down and work through it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's efforts focus on two separate but intertwined economic packages. The first is the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure deal, which nearly two dozen Senate Democrats and Republicans brokered in principle last month. Lawmakers in the group gathered late Tuesday to continue hashing out several outstanding issues, with the goal of reconciling most of their differences by Thursday and bringing a bill to the Senate floor as soon as next week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Weeks ago, Democrats embarked on a second effort to try to shepherd the more partisan aspects of Biden's social agenda into law through a process known as reconciliation. That maneuver allows lawmakers in the Senate to advance budget-related measures through a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the second package, Democrats reached a breakthrough Tuesday after days of late-night discussions, with senators announcing the $3.5 trillion reconciliation blueprint that will include massive new spending for health, education and safety-net programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats plan to expand Medicare as part of that effort, funding new dental, vision and hearing benefits, along with changes to federal law that aim to lower the cost of prescription drug prices. And the lawmakers stressed that they hope to pay for it through tax hikes on corporations and wealthy families \u2014 a non-starter for Republicans \u2014 while ramping up the ability of the government to pursue those who do not pay what they owe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While GOP senators directly negotiating the infrastructure agreement insist that the two plans are separate endeavors, their leadership noted that the bills' fates are increasingly tied \u2014 and for them, the price tag announced late Tuesday did not help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I want to look at the infrastructure bill on its own, but it's awfully hard when they continue to link them publicly not to view it through that lens,\" said Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), the party's main vote-counter. \"I think that complicates passage of the infrastructure bill for a lot of Republicans.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a White House discussion later Wednesday with a bipartisan group of mayors and governors, Biden said he believed the infrastructure deal being finalized by Democratic and Republican senators was in \"good shape.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked whether he was concerned about having a budget plan supported by only Democrats moving in parallel with a bipartisan infrastructure proposal, Biden said \"the only way to get it done is to have two tracks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reconciliation deal is larger than some spending-wary moderate Democrats wanted but smaller than liberals \u2014 including Sanders, who had advocated for a $6 trillion package \u2014 initially envisioned. But Sanders has mounted a full-throated defense of the scaled-back proposal, saying it could become the most significant spending on government programs since the Great Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats-only agreement reached Tuesday evening would also extend an expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 payments that will begin Thursday for a benefit enacted this year as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. It further aims to include funding for universal prekindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, child care programs, paid family and medical leave, and nutrition assistance. And it includes plans to enact a pathway to permanent residency for immigrants who lack legal status, although how that program would be shaped is to be determined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another liberal leader, called the plan a \"strong first step.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'll be in there fighting to make sure that we have full funding for universal child care and enough money to attack the climate crisis head on and make sure that billionaires and giant corporations pay a fair share and get this thing funded,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began rallying her troops around the Senate plan, saying in a letter to Democratic lawmakers that \"this budget will make bold, essential investments in our values as a nation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three House Democratic aides to liberal lawmakers said while there is frustration among progressives with the $3.5 trillion price tag, attempts to cut costs even lower to appease moderates such as Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) would infuriate their base. Still, some of the aides were surprised that Sanders \u2014 who leads the Senate Budget Committee \u2014 was able to strike a deal higher than $1 trillion, considering the dynamics in the Senate Democratic caucus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I see this as a down payment,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a leader of progressives in the House. \"I think this will be a significant down payment on a real investment into our people, but it's not the end.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the $3.5 trillion package, Manchin said he is waiting to review the details \u2014 but stressed that a key decision-making factor for him is whether it is fully paid for. He also warned that raising the corporate tax rate too dramatically from its current rate of 21 percent could impede U.S. global competitiveness, and he reiterated Wednesday that a rate of 28 percent \u2014 proposed by the White House and supported by most Senate Democrats \u2014 \"doesn't make any sense at all.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sinema (D-Ariz.) similarly indicated she is waiting on further details, according to an aide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matt Viser contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

After all, it has happened before.  When scientists found that chemicals used in refrigeration and aerosol cans were depleting a protective layer of ozone over the Earth, risking widespread skin cancer and death, nations agreed under the 1988 Montreal Protocol to a solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And guess what? It worked. Use of the chemicals was cut drastically. While the damage will take decades to correct, an ozone hole over Antarctica each year has grown smaller.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Global warming is a far greater and more complex threat. But the answer is still the same \u2014 the world's nations acting as one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, Donald Trump knows better.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Signed by nearly 200 nations</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the president took the earliest opportunity, under complex United Nations rules, to begin the year-long process of extracting the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord signed by nearly 200 nations.  America will be the only country to leave the accord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the agreement, the world's nations established voluntary goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and working to prevent the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius (3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Average temperatures have already risen more than 1 degree C (1. 8 degrees F). The agreement, though far from perfect, is the best effort so far toward united action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: President is right to get us out of the bad Paris Agreement</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Trump knows better.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He ignored his own federal scientists, and hundreds of others worldwide, who found evidence last year that the planet is warming faster than expected \u2014 even since 2015.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that without reversing current trends, cataclysmic declines in crop yields and fisheries \u2014 added to losses from from bigger storms, longer droughts and fiercer wildfires \u2014 will cost the U.

Under Trump's watch, America reversed a three-year trend in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and recorded a 3. 4% rise in 2018.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the name of reducing regulations, Trump dismantled, or is dismantling, Obama-era limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and vehicles.

Henry Waxman, D-Calif., thanked him for mentioning climate change, a topic environmentalists said Obama had avoided during much of his first term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I did more than mention climate change,\" the president told Waxman.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In discussing climate change with a sense of urgency before a national audience, Obama elevated expectations that the issue is in the top tier of second-term priorities along with fiscal reform, gun control and immigration reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,\" he said Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many environmentalists have come to believe that the president's more frequent, detailed mentions of climate change since the election could signal a greater willingness to step up reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama isn't ruling out the idea of a legislative package to combat climate change during his second term, senior officials say. But the political landscape is less favorable for passage of legislative initiatives than during his first term, which means that in the near term at least, Obama will likely rely on executive authority and Environmental Protection Agency rules to avoid fights with Congress in a bid to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think the president isn't just about talk,\" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite Obama's public reticence on climate change during his first term, his administration moved aggressively on several fronts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide. The administration contends that rules to boost gas mileage and curtail greenhouse gases from new power plants will have a demonstrable effect on carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters and opponents are looking for clues about Obama's posture in upcoming decisions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final rules for greenhouse gas limits from new power plants are due by April. It remains unclear if the EPA will then roll out new rules for existing power plants, most of which run on fossil fuels and whose emissions account for almost 40 percent of the greenhouse gases the country produces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration could chip away at carbon emissions through other administrative steps, including limiting greenhouse gases at refineries, curtailing the flaring of natural gas at oil wells, and pushing energy-efficiency measures and investments in alternative energy. But over the long term, that might not be enough to cut emissions on the scale needed to show the country's commitment to fighting climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., chair of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, said any bills the White House backed to address climate change would meet stiff resistance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Cap-and-trade legislation (to provide a system of credits for limiting greenhouse gases) already failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate, and there is currently no appetite in Congress to go down that path again. ... House Republicans will continue to oppose any plan that drives up energy costs and puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House is focused on rolling out a budget and legislative plans on gun control and immigration. For the time being, aides talk about environmental measures as if they are part of an ongoing project the president thinks is going well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about whether the president might push for a big, controversial legislative proposal like the cap-and-trade package that failed in his first term, White House press secretary Jay Carney suggested the president is more interested in actual change than in proposals for their own sake.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With climate change, he said, \"you don't pursue action that helps deal with that problem just because of the problem itself, but because there are huge opportunities there in alternative energy.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>nbanerjee@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Neela Banerjee and Christi Parsons, Tribune Washington Bureau</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Christian ministers and clergy from other faiths offered prayers Tuesday during the national prayer service at the National Cathedral in Washington.

The 2018 midterm election results and the tenor of the early stages of the 2020 presidential race show that, in most areas, progressives have pushed Democrats left on a number of issues. Candidates are discussing Supreme Court expansion, reparations, single-payer health care, and free college \u2014 in addition to the Green New Deal. Even Biden\u2019s seemingly moderate campaign is more liberal than any of his previous runs for office in his 50-year political career.The establishment is nervous. Older, more moderate Democrats say the way back to the White House is to reclaim many people who voted for President Trump in 2016, and they point to wins by moderate Democrats in 2018 congressional races and Midwestern gubernatorial contests as proof of their strategy. The more candidates who embrace far-left positions like the Green New Deal, the more unsettled many moderates become.Democrats of all stripes are up against the Trump campaign juggernaut. The president\u2019s reelection campaign, as you can see from his campaign rallies, has largely been about energizing his base with sweeping and incendiary attacks against his opponents. Democrats, despite the infighting, have largely kept the primary debate focused on policy.

The report by NOAA, NASA and five other federal agencies \u2014 updating a study from 2017 \u2014 predicts that ocean levels along U.S. coasts will increase as much by 2050 as they did over the past century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This amount of water battering the coasts \"will create a profound increase in the frequency of coastal flooding, even in the absence of storms or heavy rainfall,\" NOAA said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're unfortunately headed for a flood regime shift,\" said William Sweet, an oceanographer at the NOAA National Ocean Service and the nation's top scientist on sea level rise. \"There will be water in the streets unless action is taken in more and more communities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing on data from tidal gauges and satellite imagery as well as cutting-edge models from the most recent United Nations report on climate change, the NOAA analysis gives decade-by-decade projections for sea-level rise for all U.S. states and territories over the next 100 years. Advances in ice sheet modeling and better observational data allowed the authors to give more definitive near-term projections than ever before, Sweet said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if the world takes swift action to curb carbon emissions, he said, the trajectory for sea level rise \"is more or less set over the next 30 years.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kristina Dahl, a principal climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said research she and colleagues have done suggest that 10 to 12 inches of sea level rise by 2050 would put roughly 140,000 homes at risk of \"chronic inundation,\" or flooding every other week on average.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, she said, high-tide flooding in places such as Charleston, S.C., has quadrupled in frequency since the 1970s. Other regions, from Louisiana to New Jersey to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, have wrestled with flooding that has become more common and costly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They're already having to make difficult decisions or major investments to cope with the flooding they are seeing,\" said Dahl, who was not involved in Tuesday's report. While other coastal communities have avoided major impacts, \"they will have to start grappling with these same kind of issues.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Looking ahead to the end of the century, the amount of planet-warming pollution people release into the atmosphere could mean the difference between sea levels stabilizing at about two feet above the historical average or surging by almost eight feet, NOAA reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This report is a wake-up call for the U.S., but it's a wake-up call with a silver lining,\" NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told journalists in a teleconference Tuesday. \"It provides us with information needed to act now to best position ourselves for the future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In years past, powerful storms pushing water up shorelines were the primary drivers of flooding along coasts. But as surging seas raise the level of high tides, communities from the Gulf Coast and the Pacific Northwest to the beaches of Hawaii and the barrier islands of North Carolina increasingly suffer from \"sunny day\" floods, when saltwater bubbles up from storm drains and spills into streets without a drop of rain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report released last year by Sweet and his Ocean Service colleagues found that U.S. coastlines experience twice as much high-tide flooding as they did just 20 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the middle of the century, the new NOAA analysis finds, minor high-tide flooding events could happen more than 10 times a year. More significant and destructive events, which currently have about a 4 percent chance of happening in a given year, could occur twice a decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What we are trying to communicate to folks is these are real-life impacts that will influence their day-to-day decision-making,\" Sweet said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coastal communities must start planning for regular inundation, scientists warned, especially in places where coastal development and sinking land compound the risks of sea level rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Storm and wastewater systems may need to be upgraded to cope with the influx of seawater. Homes and important infrastructure located within the new upper bounds of high tides might have to relocate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The consequences could go beyond floods. Saltwater threatens to infiltrate coastal aquifers, affecting water quality and sterilizing farm fields. The septic systems used in many coastal communities won't be able to safely handle waste as water tables rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ports could see severe damage, said NOAA National Ocean Service Director Nicole LeBoeuf \u2014 disrupting supply chains and raising costs even for people who live hundreds of miles from coastlines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Tuesday's report makes clear that a certain amount of sea level rise is essentially guaranteed based on the world's past emissions, Dahl said that reality only underscores the importance of reducing greenhouse gas pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The fact that there's this locked-in sea level rise is not a reason to throw up our hands and say there's nothing we can do about this, because there absolutely is,\" she said. \"This decade we're in right now is one of the most consequential decades for our climate future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is because only by acting rapidly to reduce global emissions can the world limit Earth's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels \u2014 the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If nations fail to hit that target, she said, it risks destabilizing the Antarctic ice sheet and creating conditions for catastrophic amounts of sea level rise in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's really critical that we start bringing our emissions down quickly and steeply,\" Dahl said, \"so that we don't get anywhere near those tipping points.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reports finds that if warming exceeds 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, there's at least a 50 percent chance of sea level rise exceeding 1.6 feet on average globally by 2100. With 3 to 5 degrees Celsius of warming, that likelihood balloons to 80 to 99 percent. The sea level rise in the United States would be near or higher than the global average.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Compared with NOAA's sea level rise projections made in 2017, the new estimates are largely unchanged through 2100. However, the expected rate of sea level rise is slightly slower through 2050, before accelerating toward the end of the century. The agency also eliminated an \"extreme\" scenario of over eight feet of sea level rise by 2100 that it now considers implausible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reide Corbett, dean of Integrated Coastal Programs at East Carolina University and executive director at Coastal Studies Institute, said the NOAA report is important because it so clearly and definitively details a real-world threat posed by climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need to make people understand this isn't just a bunch of scientists talking and arm-waving. This is really happening, and it's happening on time scales that matter to the individual,\" said Corbett, who was not involved in the study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we're talking about 2050 \u2014 for someone buying a house today, that's within the range of their mortgage.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Corbett, who lives on the flood-prone Outer Banks of North Carolina, the prospect of sea level rise is deeply personal. Just last week, he said, beach erosion caused a house in nearby Rodanthe to collapse into the sea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He hoped the NOAA findings will spur vulnerable communities to invest in adaptation measures \u2014 restoring ecosystems that help hold back floodwaters, rerouting roads and bridges to steer away from the most vulnerable spots. In some cases, he said, communities will have to make hard decisions about what places are worth protecting and when it's time to retreat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need to really start working through these challenging conversations now,\" he said. \"Not right after the next storm, but before.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Gavin Newsom on Friday directed the state's top oil regulator to immediately begin crafting a regulation to halt new hydraulic fracturing permits by 2024.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to his order to the state's Geologic Energy Management Division, Newsom asked the California Air Resources Board to study ways to phase out all oil extraction across the state by no later than 2045.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe climate crisis is real, and we continue to see the signs every day,\u201d Newsom said in a news release. \u201cAs we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, I\u2019ve made it clear I don\u2019t see a role for fracking in that future and similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom acted after ambitious legislation \u2014 which would have gone much further \u2014 died in the state Senate last week. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, while a hot button issue nationally, accounts for between 2% and 20% of California's oil extraction. Just a dozen new fracking permits have been issued statewide this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate Bill 467 would have also banned dangerous and far more common cyclic steaming techniques and imposed a mandatory 2,500-foot buffer between oil and gas operations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom opted for a far more cautious route, aiming to cut a middle path between increasingly angry environmentalists and social justice advocates on one side and powerful trade unions and politically connected oil lobbyists on the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CalGEM is also expected to announce a \"public health\" draft regulation sometime this spring that could include a buffer zone and other measures, after delaying it late last year. Drafting regulations could bullet-proof them against lawsuits, but means implementation will stretch out for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The governor's announcement did little to appease critics on either side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A top Newsom administration official said last fall that it was up to the legislature to ban fracking, and Newsom said he wanted to work with them to do it. But environmentalists and some independent legal experts say he has the authority to issue an executive order to halt drilling, especially near residential areas, at once.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe governor can and should use the power entrusted to him by immediately issuing a moratorium on drilling next to our homes, schools and hospitals to protect families from unconscionable health and safety burdens that endanger our families,\u201d said Gladys Lim\u00f3n, executive director for the California Environmental Justice Alliance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opinion: Fracking gas is too risky for our climate future</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe welcome this historic announcement ... yet we are acutely aware of the slow and often exclusionary nature of regulatory processes,\u201d said Martha Dina Agruello, Executive Director for the Physicians for Social Responsibility - Los Angeles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state's leasing oil lobbyists also lambasted the announcement, vowing to sue and take other steps if necessary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOnce again, Gov. Newsom has chosen to ignore science, data and facts to govern by bans, mandates and personal fiat,\" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of Western States Petroleum Association. \"Banning nearly 20% of the energy production in our state will only hurt workers, families and communities in California and turn our energy independence over to foreign suppliers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThrough all means possible, we will join with workers, community leaders and others who wish to protect access to safe, affordable and reliable energy to fight this harmful and unlawful mandate. We will be a key part of an equitable energy future for California.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California Independent Petroleum Association CEO Rock Zierman said the \"Governor\u2019s legally questionable announcement\" was \"disappointing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under Newsom\u2019s direction, the state air board will evaluate how to phase out oil extraction by 2045 through the Climate Change Scoping Plan, the state\u2019s multi-year plan to achieve mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Inclusion in the scoping plan \"means that phasing out oil extraction becomes a part of California\u2019s blueprint to achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045,\" according to the governor's statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Janet Wilson is senior environment reporter for The Desert Sun/USA TODAY Network.

Political observers said it could roil the American presidential race by injecting religion into the already contentious politics of global warming. Others say it could increase questions about the morality and sustainability of a world economy driven by capitalism and consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 192-page draft, called \"Laudato Si, on the care of the common home,\" was posted online Monday in Italian by the magazine L'Espresso, sending news outlets scrambling to translate it. One passage says global warming has been \"mostly\" caused by \"the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide and others)\" that are \"generated by human action\" or \"due to human activity.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The draft says there is an \"urgent\" and \"compelling\" need for nations to reduce carbon emissions by replacing fossil fuels with new sources of renewable energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Viewed by some as a bold act by the pope to sway opinion on a controversial issue, the encyclical in many ways reflects a movement that has been growing for decades, sometimes on the margins, with some Catholic and Christian academics and individual church leaders and congregations increasingly making \"creation care\" a theological pursuit and a central ministry. In some cases, the approach has helped churches reconnect with people who felt Catholicism and other denominations had become too concerned with divisive cultural issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Many of those groups believe they have a formidable new ally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He is taking all the messages that we have been speaking about for 30 years and taking them to an international stage,\" said Jessie Dye, a Catholic who is the program and outreach director of Earth Ministry, an ecumenical nonprofit in Seattle that has run a \"greening congregations\" program for two decades. \"The most important thing to remember is that this is church teaching -- this is not new.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Vatican confirmed Monday that the text was a draft of the encyclical but said it was \"not the final text.\" It will translate the final version into English and other languages and asked other news outlets to refrain from publishing the draft \"to respect professional standards.\" Few did, though some Catholic experts on the pope declined to talk Monday about the draft, saying they wanted to respect the Vatican's plans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many experts have said in recent weeks that the encyclical is expected to establish climate change as a top papal priority at a time when scientists say it is still possible to prevent the worst of the damage it can do. Austen Ivereigh, author of \"The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope,\" said it would be the first encyclical \"issued with the intention of influencing a political process.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Previous popes have spoken in favor of environmental conservation, but Francis, who had trained as a chemist, has put greater emphasis on the issue, not least by naming himself after St. Francis, considered the patron saint of the environment. He has called polluting a sin and, according to one cardinal, said in a homily in February that \"it is wrong and a distraction to contrast 'green' and 'Christian.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Francis' interest in the environment dates to his days as Jorge Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In 2006 and 2007, there was a border problem between Argentina and Uruguay over pulp mills and questions over their environmental fallout,\" Pablo Osvaldo Canziani, a scientist at Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council, said in an interview. \"Bergoglio tracked me down ... on Holy Friday to discuss it. That is how closely he was following it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a speech in October to the World Meeting of Popular Movements, a group of grass-roots activists and workers, Francis said, \"Climate change, the loss of biodiversity, deforestation are already showing their devastating effects in the great cataclysms we witness, and you are the ones who suffer most, the humble, those who live near coasts in precarious dwellings or who are so vulnerable economically that, in face of a natural disaster, lose everything.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>william.yardley@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Times staff writer Yardley reported from Seattle and special correspondent Kington from Rome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: POPE FRANCIS arrives for his audience with convention participants at St. Peter's Square.

The program, he said, aims to enlist investors in efforts to reduce emissions across entire regions or countries by paying developing nations to shut down fossil-fuel energy sources and accelerate the construction of renewable energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current $2 billion carbon-credit market is unregulated, leading to what critics consider low-quality projects that don't yield durable emissions reductions. Some firms have pledged not to rely on carbon offsets, saying the credits shouldn't substitute for more direct action to wean their operations off fossil fuels. U.S. officials aim to raise tens of billions of dollars in new funding through ETA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carbon credits are typically issued by projects that preserve forests, which absorb greenhouse gases, or by renewable-energy projects that replace fossil fuels, with each credit representing the reduction or removal of one ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Polluters subtract their carbon-credit purchases from their annual carbon footprints to claim carbon-neutral operations. One weakness under the current system is that it grants credits for building individual renewable-energy projects, but doesn't ensure that there are net emissions reductions across a broader area.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Unfortunately, some past abuses have in many minds discredited the use of a carbon credit,\" Mr. Kerry said. \"But we also know that with the right safeguards, with the right transparency, with the right accountability for the right crediting, this can be done well.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In pushing national and regional governments to oversee the issuance of credits, the U.S. program aims to ensure that any reduction in emissions from one project isn't undermined by the creation of new fossil fuel projects elsewhere in the area. That would give investors confidence to increase the flow of money to emissions-reduction efforts, Mr. Kerry said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kerry said the program will also include restrictions on how companies can use the credits they purchase. Fossil-fuel producers wouldn't be allowed to buy them, Mr. Kerry said, and other restrictions would stop companies from buying them to avoid reducing their own emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They must use these credits to supplement, not substitute for deep reductions of their own emissions,\" he said. \"If you apply it in a way that isn't double counting, that's not greenwashing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zaheer Fakir, South Africa's lead climate negotiator, said the carbon-credit plan was no substitute for money the U.S. is supposed to be providing under U.N. climate treaties. The U.S. said at last year's U.N. conference in Scotland that it would give $50 million to the U.N. Adaptation Fund, but the money hasn't arrived yet. U.S. officials say they are working to get it approved by Congress. The U.S. also still has $2 billion in arrears to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which provides climate finance to the developing world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Anything to deflect from their failures to be a responsible multilateral party,\" Mr. Fakir said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. said the credits issued under the program couldn't be used to comply with legal limits on carbon-dioxide emissions, such as those in California or the European Union.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris accord of 2015 calls for global emissions in the second half of the century to reach net zero, meaning man-made greenhouse gas emissions are so low they can be completely offset by forests and other natural means of absorbing them from the atmosphere. Scientists say achieving net-zero emissions is crucial for hitting the Paris accord's climate targets: limiting global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius and preferably to 1.5 degrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under one U.S. proposal, companies would have to commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions across their operations by 2050 to qualify for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. also proposed allowing companies to use the credits to offset a portion of a company's so-called scope 3 emissions under the Science Based Targets initiative, a collaboration between the U.N., companies and environmental groups to cut corporate emissions in line with the Paris accord. Those are the emissions not produced directly by a company's facilities or the electricity they consume but by its suppliers or during the use of its products.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jim Andrew, chief sustainability officer of PepsiCo Inc., said he was looking to understand how long the carbon credits would last and whether they can be counted toward reducing the company's scope 3 emissions before committing any funds. \"These are the details still to be worked out,\" he said from the sidelines of the climate talks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fast-fashion giant H&M is wary of using credits to offset its scope 3 emissions. The company is focused on cutting its total emissions, most of which are produced by its fabric suppliers in developing countries that rely heavily on coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Within our own emissions and our value chain, carbon credits are not really something that the science says we should have,\" said Henrik Sundberg, who leads H&M's climate division. The company might consider using credits to offset residual emissions to reach its goal of net-zero by 2040, H&M executives said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kerry said he has garnered support from a number of countries for his plan. He said he expects an interim framework to be working by the 2023 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates, and financing to start in 2024.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Olanrewaju Shasore, senior assistant to Nigeria's vice president on policy planning, said she hopes the U.S. plan will attract private investors to the country's efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2060.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Unfortunately, access to private capital hasn't been accessible to us for too long,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mahmoud Mohieldin, a U.N. official working with businesses to implement the Paris agreement, and former Egyptian investment minister, was cautious about the U.S. plan. Egypt is lining up wind and solar power to replace fossil fuel, projects that he said are ready to soak up funding from the U.S. program. Mr. Mohieldin pointed to an Egyptian food, water and energy program that has already received funding from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need to see the money,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com , Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com and Eric Niiler at eric.niiler@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Plan to Ramp Up Carbon Credits Faces Doubts at COP27</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Matthew Dalton, Chao Deng and Eric Niiler\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

The authorities said that the fire then spread in a northwesterly direction, ravaging native vegetation and blackening more than half of the island, much of which is a national park known as K\u2019gari that is renowned for its beaches, rainforest, and immense biodiversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conflagration was ultimately controlled earlier this month after heavy rains helped firefighters contain the blaze. Residents said they were traumatized by the smoke and rapid evacuations, but no injuries or deaths were reported.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Local officials said that the men were cooperating with the authorities and felt deeply remorseful. A fifth male, 17, was also present, but as a minor has not been charged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey\u2019re shocked and devastated,\u201d David Harbison, a police official at Maryborough Station, near the island, said at a news conference on Tuesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey were careless, but they never intended this to happen,\u201d he added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deliberately set a fire to set fire to the island.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blaze was the first significant bushfire so far in Australia\u2019s annual fire season, the ferocity of which scientists say is becoming increasingly difficult to predict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the last fire season, bushfires across Australia\u2019s southeast coast killed 33 people, destroyed thousands of homes and more than a billion native animals. The world\u2019s attention was captured by scenes of holidaymakers trapped on beaches, where the morning sky turned pitch black and birds fell dead from the sky.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the time, conservative Australian politicians and media outlets promulgated the myth that arsonists were largely to blame for the ferocity of the flames, in what critics said was an attempt to shift attention away from climate change, which they said was the true culprit. Officials said lightning strikes were most likely responsible for a majority of the fires during that season.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though the Fraser Island fires were sparked by people, scientists said it was crucial to remember that hotter and drier conditions are ultimately to blame for the speed with which the fires spread and the scale of their destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cClimate change is making landscapes a lot more receptive to fire, because of longer fire seasons and drier fuel,\u201d said David Bowman, a professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania. \u201cThe risk of accidental fires is escalating,\u201d he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, Professor Bowman said, the environment remains susceptible to fire even with tighter controls over human activity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe can\u2019t prosecute nature, but we can regulate humans,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many national and state parks in Australia, where summer temperatures frequently exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, have seasonal or total bans on lighting campfires because of the risk they pose to the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Campfires are largely banned year-round on Fraser Island, which is the world\u2019s largest sand island, and is listed by the United Nations as a heritage site because of its unique ecosystem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Local rangers said that witnesses had filmed the men and made note of their vehicles, which helped the authorities bring the charges. The rangers went to the men\u2019s campsite, according to investigators, but by that point flames had already been sparked in nearby vegetation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A nine-week struggle to extinguish the flames ensued. Firefighters, battling sandy terrain, waterbombed the region extensively. In the meantime, the staff and guests of one of the resorts on the western side of the island were evacuated. The nearby community of Happy Valley, with a population of about 770, narrowly escaped destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The four men \u2014 a 21-year-old, a 23-year-old and two 24-year olds from south of Brisbane, Queensland\u2019s capital \u2014 will appear at the local magistrates court in Hervey Bay on Jan. 21.  The 17-year-old male will be dealt with separately under Australia\u2019s Youth Justice Act. Under Australian law, their names have not been released.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Professor Bowman, the fire expert, said that for the majority of Australians, who live in urban areas, it might be difficult to understand just how out of hand a small fire could become.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit unimaginable for them that a fire could escalate,\u201d he said, \u201cand burn half a world heritage area.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

Mr. Koonin argues not against current climate science but that what the media and politicians and activists say about climate science has drifted so far out of touch with the actual science as to be absurdly, demonstrably false.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not an altogether innocent drifting, he points out in a videoconference interview from his home in Cold Spring, N.Y. In 2019 a report by the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences claimed the \"magnitude and frequency of certain extreme events are increasing.\" The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is deemed to compile the best science, says all such claims should be treated with \"low confidence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2017 the U.S. government's Climate Science Special Report claimed that, in the lower 48 states, the \"number of high temperature records set in the past two decades far exceeds the number of low temperature records.\" On closer inspection, that's because there's been no increase in the rate of new record highs since 1900, only a decline in the number of new lows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Koonin, 69, and I are of one mind on 2018's U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, issued in Donald Trump's second year, which relied on such overegged worst-case emissions and temperature projections that even climate activists were abashed (a revolt continues to this day ). \"The report was written more to persuade than to inform,\" he says. \"It masquerades as objective science but was written as\u2014all right, I'll use the word\u2014propaganda.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Koonin is a Brooklyn-born math whiz and theoretical physicist, a product of New York's selective Stuyvesant High School. His parents, with less than a year of college between them, nevertheless intuited in 1968 exactly how to handle an unusually talented and motivated youngster: You want to go cross the country to Caltech at age 16? \"Whatever you think is right, go ahead,\" they told him. \"I wanted to know how the world works,\" Mr. Koonin says now. \"I wanted to do physics since I was 6 years old, when I didn't know it was called physics.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He would teach at Caltech for nearly three decades, serving as provost in charge of setting the scientific agenda for one of the country's premier scientific institutions. Along the way he opened himself to the world beyond the lab. He was recruited at an early age by the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit group with Pentagon connections, for what he calls \"national security summer camp: meeting generals and people in congress, touring installations, getting out on battleships.\" The federal government sought \"engagement\" with the country's rising scientist elite. It worked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He joined and eventually chaired JASON, an elite private group that provides classified and unclassified advisory analysis to federal agencies. (The name isn't an acronym and comes from a character in Greek mythology.) He got involved in the cold-fusion controversy. He arbitrated a debate between private and government teams competing to map the human genome on whether the target error rate should be 1 in 10,000 or whether 1 in 100 was good enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He began planting seeds as an institutionalist. He joined the oil giant BP as chief scientist, working for John Browne, now Baron Browne of Madingley, who had redubbed the company \"Beyond Petroleum.\" Using $500 million of BP's money, Mr. Koonin created the Energy Biosciences Institute at Berkeley that's still going strong. Mr. Koonin found his interest in climate science growing, \"first of all because it's wonderful science. It's the most multidisciplinary thing I know. It goes from the isotopic composition of microfossils in the sea floor all the way through to the regulation of power plants.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From deeply examining the world's energy system, he also became convinced that the real climate crisis was a crisis of political and scientific candor. He went to his boss and said, \"John, the world isn't going to be able to reduce emissions enough to make much difference.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Koonin still has a lot of Brooklyn in him: a robust laugh, a gift for expression and for cutting to the heart of any matter. His thoughts seem to be governed by an all-embracing realism. Hence the book coming out next month, \"Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any reader would benefit from its deft, lucid tour of climate science, the best I've seen. His rigorous parsing of the evidence will have you questioning the political class's compulsion to manufacture certainty where certainty doesn't exist. You will come to doubt the usefulness of centurylong forecasts claiming to know how 1% shifts in variables will affect a global climate that we don't understand with anything resembling 1% precision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book lands at crucial moment. In its first new assessment of climate science in eight years, the U.N. climate panel\u2014sharer of Al Gore's Nobel Peace Prize in 2007\u2014will rule anew next year on a conundrum that has not advanced in 40 years: How much warming should we expect from a slightly enhanced greenhouse effect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The panel is expected to consult 40-plus climate computer simulations\u2014testament to its inability to pick out a single trusted one. Worse, the models have been diverging, not coming together as you might hope. Without tweaking, they don't even agree on current simulated global average surface temperature\u2014varying by 3 degrees Celsius, three times the observed change over the past century. (If you wonder why the IPCC expresses itself in terms of a temperature \"anomaly\" above a baseline, it's because the models produce different baselines.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Koonin is a practitioner and fan of computer modeling. \"There are situations where models do a wonderful job. Nuclear weapons, when we model them because we don't test them anymore. And when Boeing builds an airplane, they will model the heck out of it before they bend any metal.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"But these are much more controlled, engineered situations,\" he adds, \"whereas the climate is a natural phenomenon. It's going to do whatever it's going to do. And it's hard to observe. You need long, precise observations to understand its natural variability and how it responds to external influences.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet these models supply most of our insight into how the weather might change when emissions raise the atmosphere's CO2 component from 0.028% in preindustrial times to 0.056% later in this century. \"I've been building models and watching others build models for 45 years,\" he says. Climate models \"are not to the standard you would trust your life to or even your trillions of dollars to.\" Younger scientists in particular lose sight of the difference between reality and simulation: \"They have grown up with the models. They don't have the kind of mathematical or physical intuition you get when you have to do things by pencil and paper.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this you can hear from climate modelers themselves, and from scientists nearer the \"consensus\" than Mr. Koonin is. Yet the caveats seem to fall away when plans to spend trillions of dollars are bruited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the record, Mr. Koonin agrees that the world has warmed by 1 degree Celsius since 1900 and will warm by another degree this century, placing him near the middle of the consensus. Neither he nor most economic studies have seen anything in the offing that would justify the rapid and wholesale abandoning of fossil fuels, even if China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and others could be dissuaded from pursuing prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's a fan of advanced nuclear power eventually to provide carbon free base-load power. He sees a bright future for electric passenger vehicles. \"The main reason isn't emissions. They're just shifted to the power grid, and transportation anyway is only about 15% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. There are other advantages: Local pollution is much less and noise pollution is less. You're sitting in a traffic jam and all of these six- or four-cylinder engines are throbbing up and down burning fuel and just doing no good at all.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But these are changes it makes no economic sense to force. Let technology and markets work at their own pace. The climate might continue to change, at a pace that's hard to perceive, but societies will adapt. \"As a species, we're very good at adapting.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The public now believes CO2 is something that can be turned up and down, but about 40% of the CO2 emitted a century ago remains in the atmosphere. Any warming it causes emerges slowly, so any benefit of reducing emissions would be small and distant. Everything Mr. Koonin and others see in the science suggests a slow, modest effect, not a runaway warming. If they're wrong, we don't have tools to apply yet anyway. Decades from now, we might have carbon capture\u2014removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere at a manageable cost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's less keen, except in the most extreme circumstances, on what many see as the cheaper, easier fix of augmenting the aerosol effect, which already partially offsets the warming caused by greenhouse gases, by injecting particles into the upper atmosphere. The political and practical unknowns are large. \"You could have some country or even some individual do it. The policy community is just starting to grapple with that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Koonin does not drive an electric car. He drives what he jokes is the official car of Putnam County, a Subaru Outback, while he and his wife weather the pandemic in a woodsy enclave along the Hudson River. An Audi meant to haul them and the dog back to New York City, where he started and ran New York University's Center for Urban Science and Progress, collects dust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Koonin says he wants voters, politicians and business leaders to have an accurate account of the science. He doesn't care where the debate lands. Yet his expectations are ruled by a keen sense of realities. I mention, along with some names, that I never met anyone of serious judgment who didn't privately pooh-pooh the idea that humanity will control CO2 by means other than the mostly unregulated progress of markets and technology. Mr. Koonin nods his agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He speaks of \"could,\" \"should\" and \"will\"\u2014and what \"will\" happen is a lot less than elites, in response to current reward structures, are pretending will happen. Even John Kerry, Joe Biden's climate czar, recently admitted that Mr. Biden's \"net-zero\" climate plan will have zero effect on the climate if developing countries don't go along (and they have little incentive to do so). Mr. Koonin hopes that \"a graceful out for everybody\" will be to see the impulse for global climate regulation \"morph into much more impactful local environmental action: smog, plastic, green jobs.

The consequences offer lessons for other parts of the developing world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COMOROS \u2014 Hundreds of brightly clad women flock to the banks of the river each week to scrub their way through bundles of laundry. Some of them travel hours from tiny villages to access a critical but increasingly endangered resource here on the island of Anjouan: water.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The island, part of the nation of the Comoros off the East African coast, receives more annual rainfall than most of Europe. But a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused at least half of its permanent rivers to stop flowing in the dry season.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1950s, the island has been clearing forests to make way for farmland and in the process disrupted a delicate ecosystem. With so many trees and plants cut down, the water they would normally collect and feed back into the ground and rivers is disappearing. Families in parts of the island now struggle to meet their domestic needs, and farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to irrigate their fields.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost 40 permanent rivers in the last 50 years,\u201d said Mohamed Misbahou, the technical director of Dahari, a nonprofit focused on reforesting land in some of the hardest hit areas on the island. \u201cIn some parts of the country, there\u2019s now a big problem getting water.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The drying rivers of Anjouan are part of a web of environmental problems on the island and a potent example of how developing nations with ever more mouths to feed are struggling in the face of climate change, deforestation and population growth. The challenges it is seeing now are likely to become more acute in other parts of the developing world in years to come, experts warn.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe\u2019re faced with increasing temperatures over time, so we know different crops will respond differently, as well as more extreme weather events, and that makes it harder for farmers,\u201d said Alex Forbes, a manager for the United Nations Environment Program\u2019s work on adapting to climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that we need to collectively improve on land management in order to sustain livelihoods and production.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With dwindling crop returns and farms being divided into smaller and smaller plots with each generation, tens of thousands of people have left their villages in the Comoros to look for work elsewhere. Anjouan, in particular, has become a major departure point for migrants in the archipelago trying to reach the nearby French island territory of Mayotte.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The population of the Comoros has more than doubled since 1980, to just under one million people, putting pressure on its forests. After gaining independence from France in 1975, the country experienced one of the world\u2019s fastest rates of deforestation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lost were vast tracts of \u201ccloud forests,\u201d filled with lichens, mosses and trees designed to act like sponges \u2014 soaking up thick condensation in the air and releasing it down to the forest floor, where the water found its way into rivers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAnjouan is a small island,\u201d said Arnaud Charmoille, the author of a 2012 study into the disappearance of the island\u2019s waterways. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rain. But if you cut down even a small amount of cloud forest it will have a serious impact.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In less than two decades, between 1995 and 2014, some 80 percent of the country\u2019s remaining forest cover was cut down, disrupting waterways and leaving once-fertile soil exposed to erosion and the leaching of vital nutrients.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Crops have declined noticeably, farmers and agricultural charities say, a major problem in a place where more than three-quarters of the population is involved in agriculture. Farmers have turned to ever greater quantities of chemical fertilizers as a result.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere\u2019s been a big reduction in agricultural production, and that leads to food insecurity,\u201d said Ahmed Ali Gamao, a contractor for the Comoros environment ministry, who oversees a project funded by the United Nations to restore forest cover and aid farmers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The project has helped improve the harvesting of rainwater and planted over a million trees in the past four years, focusing on species able to withstand climate changes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere are certain species that we used to grow that we can no longer grow in our fields,\u201d Mr. Gamao said. \u201cThe agricultural seasons are changing a lot. In some places it\u2019s raining all the time, and in other places it\u2019s always dry.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the village of Adda-Doueni, Sumaila Youssouf Abdullah, a 45-year-old farmer, was packing soil into small plastic seedling bags as part of a reforestation effort run by Dahari.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhen I was young, there was a river down there, and another over there, and another just over that point there,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Restoring forests is a challenge, and cloud forest can be particularly difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to replace it,\u201d said Aida Cun\u00ed Sanchez, a cloud forest specialist at the University of York in England. \u201cYou need to save them before they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Cun\u00ed Sanchez has been conducting research in northern Kenya, where she says the loss of cloud forest is having a similar impact on rivers and streams. A 2019 report by one intergovernmental think tank predicts that global crop yields could fall by up to 10 percent by 2050 as a result of land degradation and climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United Nations estimates that just 13 percent of the population in the Comoros now has access to the quality water it needs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the small farming village of Mnadzishumw\u00e9, which sits amid groves of banana and clove trees on the southern end of Anjouan, water was once plentiful. But these days, just getting enough for domestic use is a struggle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A village water committee has been created to manage what little remains, and a system of rationing has been introduced: The communal taps are opened only once every two or three days, depending on the season.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cUsually we can get two 20-liter jerrycans for two or three days,\u201d said Sandia Halifa, a 45-year-old clove farmer with four children. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. We need to wash, we need to cook, we need to wash our clothes.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In comparison, the average American household uses more than 1,000 liters of water per day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scarcity of water in parts of the island is exacerbated by an antiquated distribution system which, if fixed, might take off some of the pressure. But as the population grows and the climate continues to heat up, that would only go so far.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Growing up, Ms. Halifa remembers doing laundry in a river in the next village. For much of the year, that river no longer exists, so every Sunday she joins the flow of women from rural villages who travel to the Jomani River to wash their clothes. The Jomani is one of only a handful of rivers on the island that still flow year round.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Halifa says the journey costs her 1,000 Comorian francs (about $2.20) each way, a significant expense in a country with a per capital annual G.N.P. of less than $1,400. For day-to-day use, the family has resorted to buying water from entrepreneurs who have started driving from village to village selling supplies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey know we\u2019re desperate,\u201d said Sumailan Mshinda, a village elder in Mnadzishumw\u00e9. \u201cThey sell us 20 liters for 250 Comorian francs,\u201d or about 55 cents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In nearby Adda-Doueni, Mr. Abdullah recalled farming in bygone days. \u201cThere was no difference between the dry season and the rainy season,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were big rivers, and there was always a lot of water.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, he added, \u201cwhen the rainy season is over, there\u2019s no more water.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This story was produced in partnership with The Pulitzer Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This story was produced in partnership with The Pulitzer Center.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

David Grant, PepsiCo's sustainability director of global water stewardship, said that involves measures such as injecting water back into aquifers in high-stress areas and working on conservation projects that make it easier for the land to absorb rainwater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're seeing increased stress on global water resources, and our process for evaluating high-water-risk areas is rigorous,\" Mr. Grant said in an email. \"Good watershed health in the locations we operate in is critical to the continuity of our business and the resilience of our communities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PepsiCo declined to say how much money it would invest in the effort. Mr. Grant said the company would make \"a significant investment at sites around the world.\" The company also contributes funding to WaterAid, a nonprofit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>High-risk sites include snack and drink plants in the U.S., Mexico and South Africa that are vulnerable to floods and droughts, Mr. Grant said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grant said one water-efficiency initiative involved reusing water at a plant in Mexico to wash potatoes for chips, a measure he said more than halved the factory's freshwater demand in a year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sweeping \"water positive\" goal goes beyond PepsiCo's several existing targets for water use. One of those targets is to replenish 100% of the water used in manufacturing in high-risk areas by 2025, according to PepsiCo's 2020 sustainability report . Last year it replenished 18%, up from 9% in 2016, the report shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PepsiCo consumed more than 28.1 billion liters of water in 2020, a 3% increase from 2019, the company reported to CDP, an environmental-disclosure organization. It attributed the growth to increased drinks production and its acquisition of South African food and drinks company Pioneer Foods Group Ltd.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Analysts at Barclays PLC said in a June report that the consumer-staples sector, which includes food-and-beverage companies, is the most at risk from water scarcity. Average municipal water prices world-wide have roughly doubled over the last decade, according to research group Global Water Intelligence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Water could have a bigger financial impact on the sector than carbon-reduction strategies, the Barclays analysts said, citing data on companies' water-related risks gathered by CDP. The organization said in March that companies that responded to its water security questionnaire in 2020 estimated that $301 billion of business value is threatened by water risks, compared with the estimated $55 billion cost of responding to the risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PepsiCo Aims to Replenish More Water Than It Uses</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Dieter Holger\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Edison doesn't face as much financial risk as its Northern California counterpart, PG&E. But Pedro Pizarro, president of Edison's parent company, recently said his utility could be one big fire away from bankruptcy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a recent filing, Edison asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to increase its shareholders' return on equity from just over 11% to just over 17% -- a number far out of line with industry standards, but which Edison says is justified because of the growing risk of destructive fires, fueled in part by climate change. The utility says an average residential customer would see a monthly bill increase of about $2.20 starting this summer, if federal officials sign off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caroline Choi, Edison's senior vice president of corporate affairs, said giving investors a 17% return on investment isn't a sustainable, long-term strategy for dealing with fire risks. But in the short term, Choi said in an interview, the company needs higher guaranteed profit margins to secure funding for key initiatives, including safety.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are having to make significant investments to harden the grid and make it more resilient to wildfire. We're also making investments to support the state's clean energy goals,\" Choi said. \"In order to attract the capital we need to make those investments, we need a return on investment that reflects the operating risks that we have today.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ratepayer advocates are crying foul.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matthew Freedman, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Utility Reform Network, sees Edison's request as a tactic to pressure state lawmakers. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature are debating how the state should pay for wildfire damage in an era of climate change and whether to shield investor-owned utilities from the full liability of fires ignited by their equipment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Freedman described Edison's request for higher profits as \"an attempt to intimidate state lawmakers into taking actions favorable to Edison's interests.\" That theory is backed up by Edison's news release, which says the dramatic increase to shareholder profits could be removed from rates \"once state policymakers have restored certainty and stability to how wildfire-related costs are addressed.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They're attempting to extort relief from the state of California by pressing for obscene rates of return from federal regulators, based on the premise that wildfire liability risks require this level of profitability for the transmission system,\" Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shareholders of California's major monopoly electricity companies -- Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric, which is owned by Sempra Energy -- have been allowed to earn returns of 10% to 12% on state-regulated assets over the last decade, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. Across the country, electric utility profits approved by state officials averaged 9.45% in the fourth quarter of 2018, down from nearly 13% in the early 1990s, according to data compiled by an industry trade group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tyson Slocum, who leads the energy program at the national consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said he plans to file a formal objection to Edison's request for a 17% return. The proposal shifts too much of the financial risk of wildfires from Edison's shareholders to its ratepayers, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's enormously generous financially for what is designed as a monopolistic investment endeavor,\" Slocum said. \"I think we've got to find another type of policy mechanism to deal with the liability issue.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State lawmakers are working on new policies with the goal of keeping additional utilities from filing for bankruptcy or losing their ability to borrow money at low rates -- all without shifting too much of the burden to ratepayers. It's a fine line to walk, with political risk on either side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom weighed in on the debate this month, outlining ideas that have been proposed but declining to endorse a particular solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, estimating that it faced $30 billion or more in potential wildfire liabilities. Investigators have found the utility's equipment sparked or contributed to more than a dozen fires than collectively killed 22 people in 2017, and PG&E says its infrastructure probably also helped start the Camp fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although Edison has stayed out of bankruptcy court, its power lines were determined to have sparked the 2017 Thomas fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The blaze killed two people and played a role in the ensuing Montecito mudslides, which killed 23 people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent months, Edison has seen its credit ratings downgraded because of fire risks, as has San Diego Gas & Electric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some California officials say that shoring up the utilities' finances is key to meeting the state's climate change goals, including a target of 60% renewable energy by 2030 and a mandate to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions 40% by the same year. Michael Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, recently described the investor-owned utilities as \"vehicles that we use to invest to meet social goals,\" including cleaner energy production and the installation of electric vehicle chargers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need those utilities,\" Picker said this month at a Los Angeles Business Council sustainability summit. \"They string miles and miles and miles of electric wires to communities that have been building out in wildfire zones, far from cities, because that's where people are moving.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Picker's agency is responsible for determining how big a profit Edison's shareholders are allowed to make on most of the company's infrastructure investments. The main exception is shareholder returns on transmission-line projects, which generally fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edison's request for a 17% return on equity would affect the relatively small portion of customer bills covering FERC-regulated assets. But Edison also plans to file a new \"cost of capital\" request with the Public Utilities Commission covering the rest of its infrastructure investments by Monday. If that request is anywhere in the ballpark of 17%, customers could see bill increases much larger than $2.20 per month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a shock-the-conscience kind of number,\" said Freedman, from the Utility Reform Network. \"I've never heard of a return on equity of that magnitude being granted.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some experts say Edison's request for higher profits is reasonable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stanford University professor Michael Wara, who was appointed by Newsom to a commission on wildfire costs and utility infrastructure, thinks the 17% figure sought by Edison is too high. In a Twitter thread, Wara described the number as \"insane,\" saying it was calculated based in part on the unrealistic assumption that state officials will never allow an investor-owned utility to recover wildfire costs from its customers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in a follow-up interview, Wara said Edison's request for higher profits is \"basically the right idea\" -- especially when the company has pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on projects to reduce the risk of fires sparked by its poles and wires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Until we can stabilize the situation, get wildfires under control, reduce risks for the utilities, we're in this really difficult position,\" Wara said. \"Just saying, 'Oh, the utilities are bad, and we're not going to give them their rate of return' isn't adequate.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Travis Miller, director of utilities research at investment analyst Morningstar, said Edison's proposal is \"substantially higher than any request we've seen in the industry recently.\" But he acknowledged Edison's circumstances are \"out of the ordinary.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Investors are going to require a higher return to invest in a company that has more risk, and certainly Edison has more risk in the current environment than most of the other utilities in the U.S,\" Miller said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edison officials say they'd support reducing shareholder returns back to current levels once lawmakers approve a plan for assigning wildfire costs. Proposals being discussed include a special fund to help utilities cover fire-related payouts and shielding utility shareholders from fire liability unless a utility is found to have acted negligently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not clear that whatever comes out of Sacramento will satisfy Edison and its shareholders, or how soon lawmakers might act. Assemblyman Chris Holden, a Pasadena Democrat who chairs the chamber's Utilities and Energy Committee, said at the L.A. Business Council's sustainability summit this month that lawmakers won't be rushed into action by dire warnings from credit rating agencies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They need to kind of stand down a little bit, because they're scaring everybody with every headline that they write, with every downgrade that they propose, and they're not giving us enough opportunity,\" Holden said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's designed to put pressure on us to move sooner than later.

Andrew M. Cuomo plans to order state regulators to mandate that, by 2030, half of all power consumed by New Yorkers be generated from renewable sources that emit much less carbon dioxide, people briefed on the matter said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has already declared a goal of having 50 percent of the state's power come from solar, wind, hydroelectric or other renewable sources in 15 years, but the state has had no means of enforcing that directive. The governor intends to have the Public Service Commission , which regulates utilities in the state, codify the requirement, these people said. Some of them, including a Cuomo administration official, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss the proposed mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mandate would be another step toward the governor's goal of a 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions from plants supplying the state's electricity. In the intervening years, the energy policy would give utilities an incentive to use power generated by nuclear plants, which are considered clean sources, though not renewable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By pushing utilities to obtain more of the power they distribute from less-polluting sources, state officials hope to delay the planned shutdown of two nuclear power plants on the shore of Lake Ontario. Aides to the governor have been trying for several weeks to dissuade Entergy from closing one of them, the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in Oswego County.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Entergy officials say they will close the plant in late 2016 or early 2017 because it has been losing about $60 million a year. Nuclear plants emit less air pollution than power plants fueled by natural gas or coal, so the loss of them would set back the state's hopes of meeting its clean-energy goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if the mandate comes too late to keep the reactor at the FitzPatrick plant operating, state officials hope it could prolong the life of the Robert E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant near Rochester. The Ginna plant's owners said in 2014 that they intended to shut it down, but state officials struck a deal to subsidize its operation to keep it running until 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cuomo administration officials want the upstate nuclear power plants to continue operating until 2030, when they hope that there will be enough sources of renewable energy to supply half of the state's needs, according to people who have been briefed on the matter. But Mr. Cuomo has taken an opposite stance on Entergy's Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County, which has two reactors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The governor has repeatedly called for Indian Point to be shut down, saying it is too dangerous to have a nuclear plant so close to a metropolis. It is perched on the edge of the Hudson River in Buchanan, about 30 miles north of Manhattan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's certainly a quandary,\" one of the people briefed on the matter, Gavin J. Donohue, the president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, said of Mr. Cuomo's positions on the upstate and downstate nuclear plants. \"It's clear that the governor is recognizing the value of upstate nuclear energy . That's a big change for the State of New York, and it's welcome news.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Donohue said he thought owners of power plants in the state would welcome Mr. Cuomo's mandate if it did not interfere too much with the market for power. \"What we're trying to get to is a market-based approach to solving climate-change issues,\" he said. \"We need to not have the government pick winners and losers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cuomo, who has positioned himself as a leader in the battle against climate change , announced an energy plan in June that drew praise from former Vice President Al Gore . Mr. Gore, a Democrat who has made drawing attention to global warming his signature cause, called the governor's proposed mandate \"a terrific and bold action,\" noting that it comes a week before the United Nations will hold a conference on climate change in Paris.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Governor Cuomo's commitment to expanding renewable energy and transforming the energy landscape in New York State reflects his longstanding leadership in the effort to solve the climate crisis,\" Mr. Gore said in a statement. \"And the timing couldn't be better. As we approach the global climate negotiations in Paris in just over a week, actions by state governments like New York State provide essential momentum toward a strong and effective agreement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rory M. Christian, the director of clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, said that Mr. Cuomo's proposed mandate was similar to one that California's Legislature passed and Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed into law last month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yeah, it's an achievable goal,\" Mr. Christian said. \"We got a man to the moon; we can get to 50 percent renewable energy.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What effect the mandate will have on consumers' electric bills is \"a concern,\" Mr. Christian said. \"Rates are always going to be a concern,\" he said. But, he added, \"the key thing is more renewables will keep those costs from going up or stabilize them.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power operate intermittently and not as reliably as plants fueled by gas, coal or nuclear. And encouraging the development of those sources may involve subsidies from ratepayers, the Cuomo administration official said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, the state official said, \"This will actually avoid the sticker shock that ratepayers experience every time there is a fuel shortage, a power plant goes offline or there is a spike in energy costs.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/nyregion/gov-cuomo-to-order-large-increase-in-renewable-energy-in-new-york-by-2030.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: PATRICK McGEEHAN\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Here\u2019s what to know as the mercury rises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exams will be postponed \u2014 and so will vacations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Governments and residents were scrambling to make preparations for the worst of the weather, expected to peak on Friday afternoon before easing over the weekend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe whole government is mobilized,\u201d President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Monday as the heat wave made headlines and dominated television.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In France, memories of a deadly 2003 heat wave that killed 15,000 people in the country and left much of Europe sweltering still loom large. Around the country, fans and air-conditioners flew off store shelves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because of the heat, the education ministry made a rare decision to postpone exams for middle school students that were scheduled for Thursday and Friday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Karine Sabatier, 47, who was on her lunch break in the Tuileries gardens in Paris near her offices on Tuesday, said that one of her two children was taking the exam, and that her family was forced to delay vacation plans because of the change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s a bit bothersome, but I understand the measure,\u201d she said. \u201cSome schools don\u2019t have any air-conditioning at all.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Paris, older, sick and vulnerable people were encouraged to sign up for a service that provides regular check-ins by phone, and city authorities announced that some parks would be open overnight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The temperatures held the potential to affect the quarterfinal stage of the Women\u2019s World Cup, which is being played in France. Regulations call for water breaks if the weather surpasses 32 degrees Celsius, or nearly 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Spain, the national weather agency issued warnings for several parts of the country, with temperatures expected to climb by the weekend to above 40 degrees Celsius \u2014 or more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 in Madrid and other inland areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As temperatures approached 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Vienna, the authorities rolled out a series of measures to help cool the streets down. The town hall installed mist showers in busy spots, sprayed the hot asphalt on main thoroughfares with water and opened up several swimming pools at no charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city of Innsbruck in the Alps gave its carriage horses the day off as it prepared for the heat, and the Vienna Zoo helped its great apes cool off with buckets of fresh water.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The German meteorological service said this week\u2019s heat would most likely exceed a June national record of 38.5 degrees Celsius, or 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, set seven decades ago in the southwestern state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Temperatures could also shatter an overall heat record for the country, the agency said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As temperatures rose in Germany, some people struggled to keep their clothes on. In North Rhine-Westphalia, a man took his clothes off in the frozen foods section of a supermarket on Monday. The police in the state of Brandenburg, near Berlin, said a man rode a scooter in the nude on a public road on Wednesday. When stopped, the man said, \u201cIt\u2019s just hot, what?\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heat wave is Europe\u2019s new normal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While scientists have yet to draw a firm connection between this particular heat wave and global warming, it fits a clear overall trend. As the climate changes because of greenhouse gas emissions, heat waves around the world are occurring more often, and they are hotter and last longer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The jet stream and other circulation patterns are changing. This favors the buildup of hot and dry conditions over the continent, sometimes turning a few sunny days into dangerous heat waves, according to Dim Coumou, a researcher at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije University in Amsterdam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Isabelle Janin, 60, who works in Paris and was reading in the shade on Tuesday, said that while the temperatures shouldn\u2019t be a cause for panic, it was worrying to see a heat wave so early in the summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf it becomes a regular occurrence in 10 years, then I\u2019ll really start worrying,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But France\u2019s national weather agency said that heat waves were already on the rise. The number of heat waves in France has doubled in the past 34 years and is expected to double again by 2050, while their intensity has also increased.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agency noted that temperatures this week were expected to reach a level not seen for the month of June since 1947, and could surpass that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some parts of Europe, this isn\u2019t even the first heat wave of the summer. In Poland, temperatures soared earlier this month and left the city of Skierniewice running out of water. The local government asked people to limit activities like watering lawns and washing cars. Alerts have been issued for nearly all provinces for the upcoming temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heat in Hungary has already broken records this month, reaching 35.8 Celsius in Budapest on June 17, a new high for this time of year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ahead of the heat wave, torrential rains fell in parts of Europe, causing floods and disruption. It took two trains heading for the Black Sea coast in Romania over 24 hours to make the journey from the west of the country after departing on Monday evening, more than double the time scheduled, because the track was washed away by the flood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Swiss government\u2019s meteorological agency, MeteoSwiss, issued a rare level 4 heat warning for some pockets of the country, its highest alert level. The city of Geneva sent out 13,000 brochures to people over age 75 with advice on how to keep safe during heat waves. A map showed parks and indoor spaces where people can cool off free.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Infrastructure could be damaged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the biggest concerns across stretches of Europe is that transit infrastructure \u2014 like tram and train tracks \u2014 could buckle and cause accidents, and the imposition of speed limits to help increase safety could slow traffic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polish officials have also warned drivers of potential cracks on the road as the sun bakes the asphalt and possible train delays as the heat scorches the tracks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Saxony-Anhalt, a state in the center of Germany, issued temporary speed limits on two sections of the country\u2019s famous autobahn, as engineers fear the heat could lead to minor road damage as the asphalt expands and buckles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On one section that usually does not have speed limits, drivers will have to slow down to 120 kilometers an hour, or roughly 75 miles an hour. On another stretch, drivers will be limited to 100 kilometers per hour, around 62 miles per hour.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Warnings about the rising risk of wildfires have also been issued in many of the affected countries, a cause for concern as there is already an increase in fires this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By mid-June, the number of wildfires across Europe had already far exceeded those in the entire 2018 season, according to the Emergency Management Service of the European Union agency Copernicus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Spain issued fire alerts for regions stretching from Extremadura, in the west, to Catalonia, in the northeast of the country, after a particularly dry winter and spring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The German state of Brandenburg was on high alert for forest fires around Berlin. Authorities worry that the fires could lead to the detonation of buried and long-forgotten unexploded ordnance from World War II.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reporting was contributed by Palko Karasz from London, Marc Santora from Warsaw, Aurelien Breeden and Constant Meheut from Paris, Raphael Minder from Madrid, and Christopher F.

I like his voice better when he tries to speak to all Americans, including those who didn't vote for him, than when he offers a programmatic agenda, as he did in his second inaugural speech. I found his speech to mourners in Newtown, Conn., more presidential than his address Monday at the Capitol, precisely because it was less political.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Obama didn't get much for his post-partisan attempts to unite the country other than gratuitous swipes from Republican legislators. At times over the past four years he seemed like the last person in Washington to believe in the center. But no more. Now to the politics of the agenda, of the patient, dry-eyed battle to move forward on issues that matter to him: climate change, gay rights, economic justice and the protection of social programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The country needs a president who can do more than advance, incrementally, a partisan agenda. An Obama who could somehow rally the country to restructure Medicare and Social Security so they can endure through the 21st century might be a great president. But Obama moved in another direction Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama in his first term was an elusive character, with a dry and reticent manner that made you wonder if he really liked politics. Looking back, it seems evident that he was learning in those first four years, testing what worked and didn't. My colleague David Maraniss, who is Obama's wisest chronicler, wrote last weekend: \"His mystery is hiding in plain sight. . . . Behind his veneer of ultra-cool control he was struggling to figure things out.\" And now, it seems, he is free to be himself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever I am trying to understand Obama, I go back and read his autobiography, \"Dreams from My Father.\" It is a remarkably clearheaded account of Obama's search for identity and the fiercely motivated, self-constructed person who emerged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What caught my eye this time was Obama's preface to the 2004 edition of the book, published just after he had been nominated to run for the U.S. Senate from Illinois. This was before the big train had left the station, in other words, and the phenomenon that is Barack Obama had been superimposed on the inner man. Obama was modestly describing the reaction to the initial publication of his book in 1995: \"The reviews were mildly favorable. . . . The sales were underwhelming\" and the author was \"glad to have survived the process with my dignity more or less intact.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, Obama wrote in 2004, he was entering national politics as a Senate candidate, \"a black man with a funny name.\" The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were still sharp in his mind, but he was wise enough to caution against overreaction: \"I know that the hardening of lines, the embrace of fundamentalism and tribe, dooms us all.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama who came into the White House in 2009 was a hothouse flower. What he concealed, as Maraniss wrote, was his inexperience. This personality has now learned and evolved; he's been in bitter fights with an implacable GOP leadership, Russian president and Israeli prime minister. The dreamer is gone, replaced by the politician. That's the tougher, more doctrinaire person we watched take the oath of office Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Weber gave his celebrated lecture about politics in 1919 in Munich to an audience that had just come through a shattering war and was trying to find its bearings. He gave a companion talk about \"Science as a Vocation\" that emphasized its independence from politics. \"The primary task of a useful teacher is to teach his students to recognize 'inconvenient' facts -- I mean facts that are inconvenient for their party opinions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the person who would succeed in politics must have something different, an inner certainty born, sometimes, of failure. As Weber wrote: \"Only he has the calling for politics who is sure that he shall not crumble when the world from his point of view is too stupid or too base for what he wants to offer.\" This strikes me as an apt description of Obama, circa 2013.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>davidignatius@washpost.com\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

And from June through August, California fires emitted twice as much CO2 as during the same period last year, and far more than any other summer in nearly two decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s the conclusion of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service, a European Union-financed agency, which estimates emissions based on satellite measurements available since 2003. Over the three months, it said, California fires released more than 75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s a small amount compared with annual worldwide CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels, which are expected to total about 33 billion tons this year. And most of the CO2 emitted by wildfires may, over time, be offset as vegetation recolonizing burned areas uses CO2 to grow. Still, any additional amount of CO2 in the atmosphere contributes to warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, fires in the Western United States released 130 million tons of CO2 this summer, according to the agency\u2019s estimates. This included about 17 million tons in Oregon, more than 10 times the amount released last year. The Bootleg fire, which burned more than 400,000 acres in July and August, was one of the largest in Oregon history. The Dixie fire in Northern California is that state\u2019s largest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Broiling summer temperatures across much of the West, coupled with severe drought, combined to make the fires grow rapidly, sometimes consuming tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe ground is drier, vegetation is drier,\u201d said Mark Parrington, a senior scientist and wildfire expert at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. \u201cAdd drought on top of that, and that accelerates the scale of the fire.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far in California, wildfires have burned about 2.3 million acres, which is below last year's totals at this date. But Dr. Parrington said emissions for June to August were higher this year because, with the drought, severe fires generally started earlier than last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wildfire season has been severe, and emissions have set records, in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere as well, the agency said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There were large fires in Western Canada and around the Mediterranean basin, including one in Greece that grew from a few acres to more than 120,000 acres in less than three weeks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Sakha Republic in northeastern Siberia, where large summer fires are not uncommon, this summer has been especially bad, with severe fires starting as early as June.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The burned area in Sakha is much larger than in California, and as a result emissions are much higher. The agency estimated CO2 emissions at more than 750 million tons over the three months, double that of the year before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the Siberian fires were below the Arctic Circle, unlike last year, when much of the burned area was in the Arctic. This year, Arctic wildfires released about 65 million tons of CO2 over the summer, the agency said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Copernicus uses data from sensors on several NASA satellites that measure surface brightness temperatures in near real time. It then looks for deviations from normal temperatures that indicate a fire, and estimates how much energy the fire is radiating.

The two leaders were tackling \u201cthe problem and menace of North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The wording on climate change in the communiqu\u00e9 represented a victory for Ms. Merkel, who played a major role in forging compromise language after France raised objections.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In most other respects, though, the summit meeting had to be a bitter disappointment for the chancellor. When the meeting was first planned for Hamburg, Ms. Merkel\u2019s birthplace, she would have reasonably expected Hillary Clinton, a likely political partner, to be the American president, and she had expected the event to be a strong part of her re-election campaign for a fourth term, with voting in September.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump tends to suck all the media air out of a room, even in Germany, where he is deeply unpopular. This summit meeting was always going to be primarily about Mr. Trump and his first meeting with P \n resident \n Vladimir V. Putin of Russia .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has also been about efforts by most of the rest of the world to cajole the American president into softening his stances on global trade and the climate, with Ms. Merkel in a secondary role, trying to come up with compromises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her standing has also suffered as Germans have been shocked by violent protests by a small bloc of anarchists who saw the G-20 as a perfect platform for their rejection of capitalism and order.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The atmosphere around Hamburg has been that of an armed camp, hardly welcoming, with 20,000 police officers asking for further reinforcements to try to protect the various leaders. So far, 213 police officers have been injured, and 43 people have been arrested and 96 more detained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Merkel expressly backed the 100,000 or so peaceful demonstrators who massed here in recent days and were marching on Saturday. She may have been hoping to show authoritarian leaders like Mr. Putin and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, how to tolerate protests in a democracy. If so, she and the security forces failed, losing control in parts of the city. Ms. Merkel was born in Hamburg in 1954, weeks before her parents moved east to Communist Germany.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was always going to be risky for Ms. Merkel, and Mr. Trump\u2019s presence only intensified what were widely anticipated to be widespread and sometimes violent protests against globalization, even though Mr. Trump is a sharp critic of globalization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether the criticism of holding the summit meeting here will hurt Ms. Merkel in the September elections is not clear. Her popular conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared on national television on Friday strongly defending the decision. Only large cities like Hamburg, a picturesque Hanseatic port, have the infrastructure to host the thousands of leaders, delegates, journalists and lobbyists who gather at a G-20 meeting, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And some diplomatic work was done at the meeting, even beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings and his hyperbolic praise \u2014 regardless of his private views \u2014 of every leader he meets, including Ms. Merkel. (\u201cYou have been amazing and you have done a fantastic job.\u201d)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Working overnight, diplomats first agreed on a common text on trade, with a nod toward Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d demands for restrictions on unfair trade, but they had great difficulty on climate, with the Americans demanding a reference to the use of fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Emmanuel Macron of France said he would continue to press Mr. Trump on climate and would hold a follow-up summit meeting in Paris in December to move the Paris deal forward.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trade section in the statement the aides thrashed out read: \u201cWe will keep markets open noting the importance of reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade and investment frameworks and the principle of nondiscrimination, and continue to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his meeting with China\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump said that \u201cmany things have happened that have led to trade imbalances\u201d and that he wanted a new arrangement that is \u201cequitable\u201d and \u201creciprocal.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate section is more of a dodge. It takes note of the American decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and says the other countries regard the deal as \u201cirreversible.\u201d Yet it subtly left open the possibility that the United States could someday come back into the pact, specifying that the country is putting the brakes on its \u201ccurrent\u201d emissions pledge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It then nods toward fossil fuels, saying: \u201cThe United States of America states it will endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Saturday, trying to fortify her delicate political fortunes. He said that they had had \u201ctremendous talks\u201d on trade and were working on a \u201cvery powerful\u201d trade deal for a post-\u201cBrexit\u201d Britain that could be completed \u201cvery, very quickly.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not clear what Mr. Trump meant, since the two sides cannot sign such an agreement until after Britain leaves the European Union, in March 2019 at the soonest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington on Saturday night, also confirmed that he would eventually make a state visit to Britain, but the dates continue to be unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also on Saturday, American officials said that Mr. Trump would order the State Department to redirect $50 million from its foreign-aid budget to a new international public-private partnership to aid midsize businesses run by women, a group that his daughter Ivanka Trump helped create.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The partnership aims to \u201chelp women in developing countries gain increased access to the finance, markets and networks necessary to start and grow a business,\u201d a spokesman for Ms. Trump said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The contribution comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s administration weighs a drastic scaling-back of foreign aid as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign pledge to target federal funding to create jobs at home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His budget, released in April but largely ignored on Capitol Hill, would include deep cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, a major conduit for foreign assistance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/world/europe/group-of-20-climate-change-agreement.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: STEVEN ERLANGER, ALISON SMALE, LISA FRIEDMAN and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Jerry Brown and lawmakers have cut the $500 million originally earmarked for this popular subsidy and other efforts to make heavy-duty trucks more environmentally friendly down to zero, the result of a political impasse and questions over the future of the state's climate change programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without the funds, the clean-car program, which has helped put 150,000 low- and zero-emission vehicles on the road since 2009, is running out of money. Thousands of consumers applying for the subsidies each month now are pushed to a waiting list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike most budget cuts, the decision to slash funding isn't because of a lack of money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the decision springs from concerns over the long-term viability of the state's cap-and-trade program, California's primary means of funding efforts to combat climate change. Some environmental advocates are worried that behind-the-scenes political negotiations between Brown and legislative leaders about cap and trade have led the state to hold on to the money as an incentive for lawmakers to reach a deal this summer on extending the life of the entire program, which is facing legal questions over whether it can keep operating past 2020.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think it's ridiculous to play politics with kids' lungs,\" said Dean Florez, a former state senator and now a member of the California Air Resources Board, the agency that regulates greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clean-car subsidies get their cash from auctions that are part of cap and trade. The program functions by capping how much greenhouse gas can be emitted into the atmosphere and requiring oil refineries, manufacturers and other companies to obtain permits, each allowing 1 metric ton of emissions. Those permits can be purchased at auctions or traded in a market, a system intended to provide a financial incentive to reduce emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the latest auction of permits produced almost no revenue, the state had previously stockpiled $1.4 billion in the fund. Some of that cash is left over from last year, when the governor and lawmakers also were unable to reach an agreement on how to spend it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"With the urgency of the climate crisis, we really shouldn't delay in investing in projects that reduce emissions,\" said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Brown administration spokeswoman didn't directly address questions about the use of existing climate change dollars as leverage to extend the program. But the governor does want a new law to ensure the program's future, and he endorsed an extension through new legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"An extension will not only provide market certainty, but will ensure ongoing funding for clean energy programs, especially in vulnerable communities,\" Brown spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman told The Times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clean vehicle programs are essential to the state's ambitious climate change goals. Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols has said all internal combustion engine cars must be off the road by 2050 to meet Brown's target of drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions by that time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2009, the state began subsidizing consumers who wanted to buy cleaner cars. Currently, the state offers rebates of up to $6,500 toward the purchase or lease of new vehicles that run on electricity, plug-in hybrids and fuel cells. The 150,000 cars on the road subsidized by the program include 33,000 Chevrolet Volts, 29,000 Nissan Leafs and 25,000 Tesla models.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More recently, the state added two incentives also funded by cap-and-trade dollars for low-income drivers in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles to buy new and used clean cars. Programs targeted to these residents are considered particularly important not only because they struggle to afford electric cars, but also because they're often stuck behind the wheel of older, dirtier vehicles that cause more pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coupled with other state subsidies, low-income residents in those regions can receive as much as $13,500 for a new electric vehicle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The program managed by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has taken a 1972 Ford Courier, 1979 Chevrolet Impala, 1979 Ford Ranchero and hundreds of other cars 20 years and older off the road in favor of electric vehicles and hybrids.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few months ago, Gabriel Lua, 31-year-old mail worker for a San Joaquin Valley school district, purchased a 2013 Chevrolet Volt to replace his 1987 Honda Civic. The Civic had been giving him exhaust headaches and made him worry about the health of his children, who are 3 and 5.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even though the Civic had failed the state's smog test three times and was costing him hundreds of dollars a month in maintenance, Lua said he couldn't afford to replace it until he learned about the incentive program. The state covered more than half the new car's price tag.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It saves me gas. It saves me money. I feel safer. And most important, it's for my kids,\" Lua said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Seyed Sadredin, executive director of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, said he's worried that others won't be able to receive the same deal Lua did and what that might mean for his community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadredin said cars and heavy-duty trucks make up more than 65% of pollution in the valley. The clean-car incentives are indispensable to meeting the region's climate change goals and its requirements under the federal Clean Air Act, he said, but the district expects to drain the last of its $6.4 million for incentives within the next two months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That could be devastating to our efforts,\" Sadredin said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any San Joaquin Valley residents applying for vehicle subsidies now get placed on a waiting list, as do those seeking similar dollars in Los Angeles. In recent weeks, the website of the state's main low-emission vehicle rebate program has been updated to greet visitors with a graphic saying that it has run out of money and anyone eligible would go on a waiting list.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automobile industry representatives also are concerned about the funding problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Car makers signed agreements with the state committing to the production of cleaner vehicles with the understanding that public dollars would go toward incentive programs, said John Bozzella, the president and chief executive officer of Global Automakers, an umbrella group representing the U.S. divisions of 12 motor vehicle manufacturers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If you're measuring based on the requirements in the [zero-emission vehicle] program, the numbers are very low,\" Bozzella said. \"And that would suggest to us that you need every tool in the toolbox.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Earlier this year, officials were operating under a different plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In January, Brown proposed spending $500 million on low-carbon transportation programs in the coming year, including $230 million on the primary low-emission rebate program for consumers and $30 million to expand the programs targeted to low-income residents in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles. The new dollars were supposed to get 100,000 additional clean cars on the road.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Earlier this month, a Brown administration finance official told a legislative budget committee that revenue from the most recent cap-and-trade auction was significantly lower than expected, which contributed to the decision to hold back the cash.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others, including Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), said the existing cap-and-trade money should be spent as soon as possible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Every time we don't spend money, more carbon is emitted into the atmosphere,\" De Leon said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>liam.dillon@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>chris.megerian@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: CALIFORNIA'S clean-car initiative helped put 150,000 low- and zero-emission vehicles such as the Tesla Model S on the road since 2009.

That was expected, but global temperature data for last year \u2014 which government scientists made public on Thursday \u2014 showed that Earth\u2019s long-term warming trend is continuing unabated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NASA researchers said that 2017 was the second-warmest year on record, behind 2016 but topping 2014 and 2015. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which uses a different method to analyze temperature data, said that 2017 was the third-warmest, behind 2016 and 2015. Both data sets are in line with the overall trend that the Earth\u2019s climate is warming because of human-caused climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s something even more startling in the data. The heat that dogged 2015 and 2016 was exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o, the Pacific climate pattern linked with higher-than-average temperatures. NOAA declared the return of El Ni\u00f1o in March 2015, and it ran through May 2016. But 2017 did not have El Ni\u00f1o turning up the thermostat. NASA\u2019s data shows that 2017 was the warmest year on record without El Ni\u00f1o.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Check out the full story here , which we published today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Housing battle or climate solution?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s a fight brewing in California that has enormous consequences for the state\u2019s climate policies. But it\u2019s not about electric cars or renewable energy, it\u2019s a battle over affordable housing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here\u2019s the back story: San Francisco\u2019s state senator, Scott Wiener, introduced a bill this month that would abolish a variety of local zoning restrictions around transit hubs in cities like San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and San Diego. It would essentially make it much easier to build thousands of new midrise housing units near bus stops and train stations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To call this bill contentious would be an understatement. Cities and towns have long been protective of their ability to control local development through zoning codes. Opponents of Mr. Wiener\u2019s bill have warned that allowing unregulated development could destroy the character of their neighborhoods or displace vulnerable communities . \u201cI would have a neighborhood with little 1920s, \u201930s and \u201940s single-family homes look like Dubai 10 years later,\u201d Paul Koretz, a Los Angeles city councilman, told The Los Angeles Times .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Wiener has disputed those concerns and argues that California\u2019s high housing costs call for bold action. Cities have made it too hard to increase density in urban areas, he says, which drives up housing prices and pushes people into the suburbs, forcing longer commutes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s too early to predict how this debate will play out. But many analysts agree that California needs to rethink its land-use policies to meet its ambitious goals on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California has set a target of cutting emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 , and in many ways it\u2019s made impressive headway. It\u2019s on track to get half its electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar. Officials plan to put more than 4.2 million electric cars on the road by 2030, up from 250,000 today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, even those herculean measures won\u2019t be enough. As several recent studies note , the state will fall short of its climate target unless people also drive less; transportation is by far the state\u2019s largest source of emissions. Adding more housing near transit stops could allow more people to be less dependent on car travel, reducing emissions significantly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s easier said than done. While technological solutions like solar power and electric cars enjoy broad popular support, revamping housing and transportation is more controversial \u2014 it\u2019s an issue that divides even environmentalists . (My colleague Conor Dougherty recently wrote a terrific piece about the bitter fights in Berkeley over increasing density.) This is one of the next big climate battles, and it\u2019s one to watch closely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your burning climate question: I don\u2019t live on the coast. Why should I pay higher taxes to save those cities from sea level rise?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This question was sent to us from Chris Brooks in Noblesville, Ind.:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I live far from the coasts. They will be spending billions/trillions on saving cities from rising seawater. Many have purposely put themselves in danger through coastal living. Why should I have to pay higher taxes to support their chosen lifestyles?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Four in 10 Americans live in coastal areas. Most of those areas, absent climate change, are no more dangerous than inland living. After all, no place is free of natural hazards. It\u2019s climate change that has made many coastal locales more hazardous in recent years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, it\u2019s impossible to overlook the creeping expense. Last year was the United States\u2019 costliest ever for extreme weather events: $306 billion in damage, much of that from hurricanes that struck coastal areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Guarding against future disasters will be expensive, too. A 2015 Rutgers Energy Institute report said protecting New York City alone from sea level rise would cost $120 billion. It is a hefty bill, but not one that will necessarily come from your tax dollars. In fact, so far, Congress has done little to help coastal areas adapt to rising waters, even though some at-risk states, like New York, contribute more to the federal coffers than they receive in federal spending.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And New York City, like many coastal areas, is an economic driver. Fourteen percent of the nation\u2019s counties that are on a coastline produce 45 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, some coastal areas prone to damage, like in Florida, Texas and Louisiana, receive a lot of money from the federal government. Some places have repeatedly benefited from the Stafford Act , under which the Treasury foots the bill for repairing storm-damaged infrastructure. Other neighborhoods have been rebuilt multiple times through the government-run National Flood Insurance Program, which is broke .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the future, the country has to decide if that\u2019s sustainable. In the long run, it may be a more effective use of your tax dollars to pay for improvements or buyouts so these communities won\u2019t need to be bailed out later. After Hurricane Sandy, New York State bought some at-risk properties, leaving behind wetlands to provide a buffer for future storms. But deciding who stays and who leaves isn\u2019t limited to coastal issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wildfires caused $18 billion in damage last year, partly because climate change is making wildfires more likely , and partly because more people are living in places that are likely to burn. Droughts in the Dakotas and Montana caused $2.5 billion in damage, and Midwestern storms $7.5 billion. In short, coastal cities are not alone in experiencing climate change\u2019s effects. But unlike the apocryphal frog in the pot of water, as sea levels rise they can see the danger coming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do you have questions about climate change?

The crops don't ripen at the usual times. The sun beats down hotter than ever before. The springs she always relied on for water have run dry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Human-caused climate change has taken so much from her people, said Longid, a member of the Indigenous Igorot community. Land from farmers. Food from children's mouths. Centuries-old rituals are no longer possible because the natural cycles they depend on are gone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We hardly contributed to the problem,\" Longid said. \"But it is us developing nations, us Indigenous people, who bear the brunt of the impacts.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And she wants compensation for what she has lost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Funding for \"loss and damage\" \u2014 unavoidable, irreversible harms caused by climate change \u2014 has long been a rallying cry of civil society groups and vulnerable nations at international climate talks. But as rising seas, devastating heat waves and shifting seasons claim more lives and livelihoods in parts of the world, the issue has become more of a sticking point than ever at the COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is actually one of the biggest shortcomings in this process,\" said Mohamed Adow, director of the Kenya-based think tank Power Shift Africa. \"We have clarity on the global goal to limit warming. But we don't have a comparable target \u2026 to help the world deal with some of the inevitable impacts of climate change.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 2020 report from the Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies found that extreme weather and climate-related disasters killed more than 410,000 people in the previous decade, mostly in lower-income countries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other research has estimated that annual loss-and-damage financial needs in developing countries could hit $290 billion to $580 billion a year by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Current levels of humanitarian funding \u2014 which must be allocated to survivors of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and violent conflicts, as well as climate crises \u2014 are less than one-tenth of that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People from hard-hit low-income communities say they are now paying the price for the wealthy world's choices: Of the planet-warming pollution in the atmosphere, more than half was emitted by people in the United States and the European Union.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We all know cumulative emissions,\" said Harjeet Singh, a New Delhi-based senior policy adviser for Climate Action Network International. \"We all know who gained most from industrialization.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Countries whose wealth was built on industries that polluted the atmosphere, Singh said, \"should have stepped up and said, 'Yes we take that responsibility to act.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while the richest nations long ago promised to set aside $100 billion a year to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change and mitigate future warming \u2014 a promise they still have yet to fully meet \u2014 they have so far been unwilling to embrace more funding for the irreversible damage already taking place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The finance for loss and damage is really missing,\" said Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser for adaptation at the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, the main international mechanism for addressing loss and damage has been a website for sharing expertise and resources around climate risks. In 2019, nations also agreed to set up a technical assistance program, known as the Santiago Network \u2014 though it doesn't yet have staff or funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We need to be honest,\" said Yamide Dagnet, director of climate negotiations at the World Resources Institute. \"At a time of despair, as we have seen this year \u2026 a website is not sufficient.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich nations have traditionally feared that opening the door to compensation for climate impacts they largely caused could lead to massive and unending financial commitments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the landmark Paris climate accord in 2015, developed countries notably agreed to language that acknowledged the \"importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.\" But they also insisted on including another clause, noting that the Paris agreement \"does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in wealthy countries that typically pride themselves on having an open wallet for international aid, such as Germany, the prospect of adding a bill for loss and damage drew a skeptical response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are not exactly sure what 'loss and damage' means. How you can define it compared to other climate finance topics?\" said J\u00fcrgen Zattler, director general of the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are still very much in the dark here,\" he said. \"This is an important topic, but I do not believe that we should find quick-and-easy-fix solutions to these issues.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said Germany had asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to study the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But advocates for loss-and-damage funding say it's a separate issue from mitigation and adaptation, the current targets of most climate finance. Mitigation aims to avoid future greenhouse gas emissions, not address the climate impacts already underway. And some disasters will be unavoidable, no matter how much communities adapt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's destroying our communities. It's killing our people,\" said Jo Dodds, president of the Australian advocacy group Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2018, a bush fire cut through her small town, destroying 69 homes. These days, Australia's fire season extends for most of the year, reigniting survivors' trauma and choking the skies with smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's not a single event anymore,\" Dodds said of that and similar disasters around the world. \"It's a lifestyle of catastrophe.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When catastrophe strikes in wealthy countries, those nations are able to provide support to citizens who have been harmed. After the 2018 bush fires, the Australian government set up a fund of over $1 billion to help fire-ravaged communities. Victims of record-setting flash floods in Germany this summer are eligible for millions of dollars in relief, and still more funding for rebuilding infrastructure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Singh said requiring developing countries to curb emissions even as they cope with deadly climate impacts is like asking someone whose house is on fire to donate more funds to the fire brigade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If I put myself in the shoes of a finance minister, what am I going to do when my people are suffering? Am I going to build a solar farm?\" he said. \"No.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First, help people recover, provide relief, make sure they are prepared for future disasters,\" he added. \"Only then will we be spending less on loss and damage and have more financial capacity and resources and attention to actually meet our mitigation goals.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the U.N. summit in Glasgow, activists see some signs of progress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged 1 million pounds (about $1,355,000) to the Climate Justice Resilience Fund for addressing loss and damage. It was the first time an industrialized nation committed to pay for climate harms incurred by developing countries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 61 countries of what's known as the \"High Ambition Coalition\" \u2014 a group that now includes the United States \u2014 released a statement recognizing the need for more resources to address the issue. And hundreds of banks, insurers, pension funds and investment firms also committed to shifting trillions of dollars away from polluting activities and directing some of those funds toward developing economies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"These are important signals that give a view of how the world is changing,\" said Mar\u00eda Laura Rojas Valejo, director of the Colombian advocacy group Transforma. \"But it's not enough.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue has become even more salient during the coronavirus pandemic, which has left many developing countries deeply in debt and unable to pay for basic services, let alone major climate investments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Real financial support for loss and damage, Rojas Valejo added, could also help rebuild trust between nations that has been fractured by the widening chasm in global vaccine access.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Finance is the glue of this process,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue has become unavoidable, and has gotten perhaps more attention during COP26 than at many other past climate summits. Rai says it increasingly will be impossible to ignore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"At 1.1 [Celsius] temperature rise, loss and damage is hitting not only developing countries but also the developed world,\" he said. \"Loss and damage is real. It is happening. We cannot really run away from it. So we need to act now.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

Radiation damages living cells, and research has linked a decrease in ozone levels to an uptick in the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. A 10% drop in atmospheric ozone could lead to 304,500 additional skin-cancer cases globally , according to the World Health Organization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other organisms, ultraviolet radiation exposure has been linked to developmental damage in amphibians and disruptions in the growth of plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The intense fire season during the \"Black Summer\" of 2019 and 2020 blasted moist smoke particles into the stratosphere, where they sparked chemical reactions that ate away at the ozone, according to the research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We noticed some unprecedented changes in the atmospheric composition,\" said study co-author Peter Bernath, an atmospheric chemist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. \"The new thing is that the smoke from the stratosphere causes these changes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new research corroborates and extends the work of another recent study , published earlier this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Both of the papers point towards satellite measurements that show that atmospheric ozone is being affected by the wildfires,\" said Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the leader of the earlier study. That research calculated an overall drop in ozone levels of about 1% above the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere in March 2020. Dr. Solomon's team included Dr. Bernath.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising global temperatures and drier conditions are leading to more-frequent massive wildfires around the world, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body convened by the United Nations. Scientists have used the emerging field of attribution science \u2014which uses rigorous mathematical tools to assess whether extreme weather events are influenced by climate change\u2014to show that climate change contributed to the severity of the Australia blazes during the \"Black Summer.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The frequency of extreme wildfires will likely rise 30% by 2050 , according to a report published in February by the U.N. Environment Programme. In the U.S., fire seasons are getting longer, and blazes are getting larger. Climate-related changes doubled the area burned in forest fires in the western U.S. between 1984 and 2015, according to a 2018 National Climate Assessment, which summarizes the state of climate science with a focus on the U.S.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the Science study, Dr. Bernath and his colleagues used satellite data to track atmospheric ozone levels over the middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere from January to December of 2020. The levels began dropping in April but took eight months to recover fully, they found. The research team also measured an increase in ozone-destroying chlorine compounds during that time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Clearly these fires are doing chemistry that we don't fully understand yet, that is capable of basically activating the chlorine and giving you more ozone loss than you would otherwise have,\" Dr. Solomon said of the wildfire-related ozone depletion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though the ozone reduction seen in conjunction with the Australia wildfires was temporary, the researchers said large wildfires could pose a persistent threat to global ozone levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The changes were triggered by the presence of smoke particles that were sucked into the upper atmosphere by fire-driven \"pyrocumulonimbus\" thunderclouds , according to the researchers. These anvil-shaped clouds suck in wildfire smoke and shoot it high into the atmosphere , akin to how volcanic eruptions propel ash miles high.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's funneling the smoke upwards through this really tall thunderstorm, and then injecting it at whatever altitude that thunderstorm reaches,\" said David Peterson, a meteorologist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory who wasn't involved in the new research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drs. Bernath and Solomon hypothesize that the smoke particles offered suitable surfaces on which the chemical reactions could occur effectively. \"The presence of the particles allows the chlorine to be more destructive towards ozone than it would otherwise be, and that's why it's concerning,\" Dr. Solomon said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the underlying chemical steps are still unclear and will need to be reproduced in a laboratory to be better understood, Dr. Bernath said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fire-generated thunderclouds have been recognized as a phenomenon only in the last decade, and their effects on the atmosphere are poorly understood. The Australia fire outbreak was noteworthy because it lasted months and sent up a record number of such plumes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The chemical effects and the chemical transformations of smoke in the stratosphere\u2014it's very much a new thing in terms of the effects of these giant plumes,\" said Dr. Peterson, an expert on pyrocumulonimbus clouds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 1970s, scientists began noticing that chlorine- and fluorine-containing chemicals in consumer products and refrigerants were eroding the ozone layer , leading to an uptick in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. In 1987, 197 countries agreed to the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty that banned the use of some ozone-destroying compounds.

As northeastern Illinois' supply of groundwater shrinks, more municipalities are considering joining that number. Joliet is the most recent, voting last month to switch in one of the most significant decisions officials said they would make.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illinois operates well below its Lake Michigan water allocation, but as the state plans for future water use, there is one unknown: climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The planet's climate is changing at a rapid pace, scientists say, resulting in life-threatening consequences and billion-dollar disasters. In Illinois, that may mean more intense storms, milder winters with more precipitation and hotter, drier summers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increased precipitation can affect how much water Illinois can withdraw from Lake Michigan, and runoff can alter water quality. Hot summers correlate to an increase in water demand. Cold snaps, like this month's stretch of subzero temperatures, pose their own threats when already leaky systems encounter main breaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Climate change brings so much more unpredictability to managing water resources in the region,\" said Marc Smith, policy director for the National Wildlife Federation. \"Tons of water one year, the next year you'll get tons of drought. It exacerbates the resource.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illinois is governed by a 1967 Supreme Court decree that stems from the reversal of the Chicago River, which long ago sent sewage into Lake Michigan. The state can divert 2.1 billions gallons a day -- a figure that includes drinking water from the lake and runoff, like rain that flows into area waterways, among other things.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If climate change continues to produce wetter weather, Illinois may have to factor in that more of its Lake Michigan water allocation will be taken up by runoff even as more municipalities like Joliet tap in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mila Marshall, a clean water advocate with the Sierra Club, said Lake Michigan is a finite resource, so we need to have ongoing conversations about capacity and climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Right now, lake levels are high. Water diversions make sense. But what does it look like when the lake levels are low?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservation efforts and infrastructure improvements may be paying off: The state for years has come in below the maximum diversion, building up a surplus. Accounting is averaged over a 40-year stretch by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and that average has been dropping for nearly three decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Runoff averaged about 30% relative to the average diversion, across nearly 40 years. From 2007 to 2017, the average diversion shrunk, but runoff accounted for a greater portion -- 39%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Long-term climate change has the potential to greatly impact this component of Illinois' diversion,\" a 2012 water supply planning report from the state found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Runoff is variable, dependent on precipitation in the 673-square-mile watershed. To offset the reversal of the Chicago River, officials count runoff in the watershed against the state's Lake Michigan total. In 2017, the last year accounting has been completed, runoff made up the largest portion of the diversion at 45%. Public water systems pumping from Lake Michigan, which send drinking water to taps, has generally been the largest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't think that there's cause for concern just yet,\" said Jeff Fuller, a hydraulic engineer with the Army Corps, referring to the runoff increase. \"Despite seeing increased users coming online with Lake Michigan water as their source, we still see this downward trend for pumpage.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for runoff, efforts like building on-site storage and looking for alternatives to pavement that blocks precipitation from making it into the ground aim to lower the total.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cheapest way to grow water supply is through protecting what's already there, said Jason Navota, a Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning director who oversees water management work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The more you do that, the more you can push a new well into the future, the more you can push a new treatment plant into the future,\" Navota said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As part of its change to Lake Michigan water, Joliet will aim to reduce its lost water -- from main breaks to meter inaccuracies -- below 10% by 2030. Earlier this month, a Joliet main under the Des Plaines River broke and leaked an estimated 6 to 10 million gallons, a severe example of the challenges communities face with leaky systems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years, more than 30% of Joliet's water was estimated to be lost, with losses totaling more than $3 million annually. In the coming years, the city will undertake an effort to replace all water mains constructed before 1970.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"How do you bring more communities on to the Lake Michigan water supply?\" said Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the Alliance for the Great Lakes. \"You conserve that supply as best you can.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAPTION: Photo: Increased precipitation can affect how much water Illinois can withdraw from Lake Michigan.

Almost five inches of rain fell in the area in the previous two days, after earlier storms had saturated the ground and swollen the Tittabawassee River, which the dam held back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one can say yet whether the intense rainfall that preceded this disaster was made worse by climate change. But global warming is already causing some regions to become wetter, and increasing the frequency of extreme storms, according to the latest National Climate Assessment. The trends are expected to continue as the world gets even warmer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That puts more of the nation\u2019s 91,500 dams at risk of failing, engineers and dam safety experts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe should expect more of these down the road,\u201d said Amir AghaKouchak, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate but this is what the trend is going to be.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, he and others say, dams in the United States and elsewhere are unprepared for the changes coming in a warming world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dam that failed Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of about 40,000 people in and around Midland, Mich., and threatening a chemical complex and toxic waste cleanup site, was designed a century ago, long before climate change was a concern.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dam, at Edenville Township, about 30 miles upstream from Midland, had severe design problems: It had been cited for having spillways that were inadequate to handle a maximum flood, whether affected by climate change or not. (A second dam at Sanford, 10 miles downstream, was overrun by the arriving floodwaters but did not collapse.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Edenville Dam was hardly alone in being outdated, with design or maintenance deficiencies or other problems that might make it unsafe. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its latest report card on infrastructure in 2017, gave the nation\u2019s dams a \u201cD\u201d grade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The average age of dams in the United States is nearly 60. And nationwide, about 15,500 are classified as having a high hazard potential; in Michigan, more than 170 dams are in that category, as was the Edenville Dam. Repairing and upgrading high-hazard dams alone could cost tens of billions of dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the mid-19th century there has been an average of about 10 dam failures a year in the United States, said Martin W. McCann Jr., a civil engineer who directs the National Performance of Dams Program at Stanford University. More than 90 percent of failed dams are less than about 50 feet high. (Edenville was 54 feet tall.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rivers and reservoirs swollen by rainfall are the cause of most of the failures. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing per se,\u201d Mr. McCann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some recent dam episodes have been shown to have a climate change link. In February 2017, at Oroville Dam in California, the tallest in the nation, heavy mountain runoff into the reservoir led to the near-failure of an emergency spillway and severe damage to the main spillway. Nearly 200,000 people were evacuated as a precaution and repairs cost more than $1 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A later study found that human-caused warming had increased early season runoff in the Sierra Nevada, contributing to the high water levels at the dam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And there is little doubt that extreme rainfall events are getting more frequent. The fourth National Climate Assessment, issued in 2018, showed that the number of heavy precipitation two-day events has increased in all regions except the Southwest since the early 1900s. And since 1950, extreme events increased by more than 50 percent in the Midwest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Bill McCormick, who is in charge of dam safety for the state of Colorado and is the incoming president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, said short-duration extreme precipitation wasn\u2019t the only problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rainfall of longer duration but less intensity \u2014 an overall wetter climate, which climate models forecast for parts of the United States in coming decades \u2014 can contribute to the risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey tend to saturate the ground,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. \u201cThen, if you do get these four- or five- inch rains, the ground can\u2019t absorb it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was evident in the Michigan disaster, he said, where even though the two-day deluge was not considered the most extreme possible rainfall event, it still overwhelmed the dam because the ground was already saturated from several days of rain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dam engineers have usually based their designs on past weather \u2014 what a decade or decades of data show about the maximum potential flood a dam would have to withstand. That would have been how the Edenville Dam was designed in the 1920s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there was no expectation that future weather patterns might be different.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This kind of thinking largely persists today, Mr. AghaKouchak said. \u201cStill, our engineering design concept is based on the so-called stationary assumption \u2014 that things will stay the same,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cBut as we get more and more evidence of changes in extremes, the question is if it\u2019s reasonable to stay with this stationary assumption,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is, probably not.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some designers are beginning to change their ways, said Robert J. Lempert, a principal researcher at the RAND Corporation who specializes in climate risk analysis. Legislation recently approved in California, for example, requires state engineers to take climate change into account when designing infrastructure projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you\u2019re building a dam you want to pull in climate change from the very beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is climate change going to affect the design of the dam, or even whether I want a dam at all?\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For existing dams, operational changes might be called for, such as reducing the water levels behind the dam at certain times of year in anticipation of more extreme storms. \u201cAnd you want to put climate change on the agenda for any maintenance and upgrades,\u201d Mr. Lempert said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those upgrades might include changing spillway designs to incorporate the kind of rainfall pattern that occurred in Michigan, Mr. McCormick said. Rather than one designed to handle high peak inflow from a short, extreme storm, designers may opt for one that could cope with larger volumes over a longer time period.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cYou need to look at how a given spillway is designed,\u201d he said, \u201cif the circumstances of the rainfall change.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

Not just in summer, but with drought-deluge cycles and higher temperatures even in cooler months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recently, an 81-year-old Van Nuys resident told me that sure, summers have always been hot, but lately they seem to have been imported from Palm Springs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Near Santa Cruz, a winery owner told me there are fewer foggy days and more high temperatures, shrinking what have long been prime grape-growing regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not everyone is alarmed, it turns out, which I've discovered since my July 18 column on climate change. Reaction has fallen into the following categories:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no climate change, and I'm a stooge to have fallen for a hoax.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Global warming exists, but it's not man-made.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change is real, but it's silly to believe California's environmental zealotry can measurably improve a global problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And lastly, if climate change is real and it's here, what can we do about it legislatively and individually?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's take a look at each one, beginning with those who believe -- as does the president of the United States and a number of his key advisors and members of Congress -- that climate change is a figment of our imaginations, or that we're overreacting to what might simply be natural variations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You see, Steve, what you call global warming, we call summer,\" wrote a reader named Jim.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They say the temps are the highest recorded in 130 years,\" wrote Joe. \"What was the excuse for the soaring temps 130 years ago when there were no cars and very, very little industrialization ... here's a clue -- it's a HOAX swallowed whole by the rush of lemmings who want to believe they are doing gooooooooooood things for the planet.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I responded by telling Joe what several climate scientists have painstakingly explained to me in recent weeks:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, unusually high temperatures have always existed, but scientists have now documented more frequent and intense heat waves of longer duration. Also, nighttime temperatures have increased, record highs now outnumber record lows by a 5-1 ratio and atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from 250 parts per million to 400 parts per million, all of which has altered climates around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Joe called this information \"crap\" that can't stand up to \"REAL SCIENTIFIC SCRUTINY.\" He suggested I look up the writings of climate scientist Judith Curry, who has long attacked the views of many climate scientists as alarmist. Curry has not challenged the notion of global warming, but has questioned the causes, and whether there has been a rush to judgment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ben Santer, a climate scientist with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, had this to say:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Professor Curry has argued (and continues to argue) that: 1) climate scientists routinely ignore important uncertainties in their efforts to quantify human influences on global climate; and 2) reality is too complex for us to comprehend; we will never understand the real-world climate system.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Santer said he disagrees with Curry on both counts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In my line of research -- climate fingerprinting -- we routinely consider uncertainties in satellite temperature data, in model simulations of natural variability, and in model estimates of the climate response to human influences,\" Santer said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Furthermore, we routinely look at other possible explanations for the observed changes in climate (such as changes in the sun's energy output and changes in volcanic activity). Uncertainty is an integral part of our work. We do not sweep it under the carpet, as Professor Curry incorrectly asserts,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He added that despite imperfect observations, it is clear \"beyond any reasonable doubt\" that evidence points to a \"human-caused warming signal\" related to greenhouse gas increases. And if we wait for more perfect data before responding, Santer warned, \"humanity is in trouble.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California isn't waiting. The state has long led the way on embracing renewable energy sources and limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Then there's the current legislation demanding better gas mileage in the near future, which is under attack by the Trump administration. But as a single state in a world of major polluters, can going green make a difference?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alex Hall, a UCLA climate scientist, has no doubt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think what's happening in California is wonderful,\" said Hall, who traded his gas-hungry car for a Chevy Bolt. \"It's a pathway forward.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalism isn't sacrifice, Hall said. It's change. And in charting a course toward renewable energy and lower greenhouse gas emissions, California is setting an agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If you look at any transformation in history, it hasn't happened all at once everywhere,\" Hall said. \"It's been a small group of people committed to change. They've made change in their communities and it scaled up from there.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lynn Sosa of Mount Washington emailed to say she wishes outdoor mall merchants would close their doors in the middle of summer, instead of throwing them open so shoppers might be lured in by air-conditioned blasts. Sosa and her husband, Jeffrey Parkin, suggested I visit Glendale's Americana on Brand, and sure enough, more than half the shops had their doors open as the temperature hit 98 one afternoon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Apple store was one of them, and Tesla was another -- a showroom with electric cars on display, along with a wall-mounted solar pitch: \"Energy Security for Your Home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe Tesla/Space X engineering guru Elon Musk has a plan to reverse global warming with air conditioning?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Actually, said the Tesla sales clerk, the AC was working so hard with the doors wide open, it had been on the fritz two or three times in recent weeks. He said keeping the doors open was mall policy, but Americana owner Rick Caruso denied that and called it unacceptable, promising to look into it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are adamant that we are environmentally sensitive,\" Caruso said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Adaptation is survival, and we have to do it in our personal and professional lives,\" said David Fink, a climate-change policy consultant whose projects include updating the state's Cal-Adapt.org website, which logs climate-change data to aid in planning decisions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have to be smarter about how we get places, how much fuel we burn, where we clear brush and where we plant trees, where we allow new housing developments and what materials we use to build them, Fink said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Laying down black asphalt everywhere is one of the worst things we can be doing,\" said Fink, who told me about light-colored coating materials that don't retain as much heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same concept is true, he added, for new roofing materials that reflect rather than absorb heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A key to all of this is that a number of these things are either free or there are incentives or rebates available,\" said Fink, who recommended going to LADWP.com and clicking on \"rebates\" for information.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are, of course, ways to have an effect on a bigger scale, or to at least try. You can speak up for candidates who understand the threat to the planet, or you can scream about destructive environmental policy bought and paid for by fossil-fuel barons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Santer said, one of the best things you can do is educate yourself. He suggested that I read \"Climate Change Evidence & Causes,\" a short summary that's been neatly laid out by the Royal Society and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up in California, lived in the Bay Area for 30 years and in Southern California for 20 more, and yes, climate variations have always existed. I can recall many extremes of dry heat and steady rain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this looks and feels different. The hills are drier and more combustible, the heat is hotter and more stubborn, the fires are bigger and more frightening, and I can only wonder what we'll be passing on to my daughter and future generations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However many naysayers there are, including a president who blames California's catastrophe on everything but global warming, leading the way on educating, planning and adapting isn't just possible, it's a moral imperative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steve.lopez@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter: @LATstevelopez</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: POLICE block off Glen Ivy Road as the Holy fire burns in the hillsides above Glen Ivy Hot Springs in Corona.

Theauthoritative body of scientists, economists and other experts previously warned that the planet is warming, that humans are primarily responsibleand that uncontrolled climate change would have a range of unwelcome effects. Those conclusions would not be too worrisome if the world were well on the way to heading off major problems. But the IPCC found the opposite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>World governments face a massive task. Scientists have recommended keeping the cumulative rise in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Getting there, the IPCC reckoned, would require a decrease in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, by 40 to 70 percent from 2010 levels by 2050. Greenhouse emissions must be near or below zero by 2100. That sort of transition requires low-carbon energy production to at least triple by mid-century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some observers argue that the IPCC's latest report shows that such a revolution in how we fuel the global economy would not actually cost that much. But it is not so clear. The group examined about 900 emissions mitigation scenarios and figured that the median estimated cost of meeting the 2-degree goal would total about 0.06 percentage points of global gross domestic product per year over the course of the century. That huge amount of money could represent the difference between abject poverty and decent conditions for people in developing countries, depending on who sacrifices to bring emissions down. On the other hand, the report noted that reducing greenhouse emissions also would result in a variety of positive side effects, including significant reductions in illnesses and deaths associated with air pollution. It is just very hard to quantify the full cost picture.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That uncertainty partly explains why the world is heading in the wrong direction. Humans released more carbon dioxide between 2000 and 2010 than in any decade before. The great recession resulted in an emissions dip, but the trend resumed its upward course as the world economy recovered. World governments have made promisesto reduce their reliance on carbon dioxide. But if they make good on current pledges -- which have not been the best indicators of what they actually accomplish -- they can only be confident of keeping warming below 3 degrees Celcius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The smartest policy scenario is one that hedges against the possibility of very bad consequences as cheaply as possible, one in which \"all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately\" and for which \"there is a single global carbon price,\" in the IPCC's words. In practice, that system would have to develop over time as many countries, led by the United States, individually establish carbon taxes or equivalent policy, then pressure others to join in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, given the many political barriers to achieving that soon, it is important to ask: What is the backup plan if the world overshoots its emissions goals? Typically, that has not been a question environmentalists have wanted to entertain. But, given the world's current trajectory, they must.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

With that in mind, the artist recently organized a yearlong virtual exhibition chronicling the creation of New York\u2019s water supply system. In collaboration with More Art, she created a capstone project for this campaign, \u201cPublic Water,\u201d a geodesic dome filled with water-filtering plants that operates like that system. Now at the Grand Army Plaza entrance of Prospect Park in Brooklyn through Sept. 7, the piece reveals what\u2019s involved in providing millions of people with this natural resource, despite the environmental challenges that threaten it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The artist Maya Lin shows what other hazards climate change can produce: a \u201cGhost Forest,\u201d her installation at Madison Square Park in Manhattan, on view through Nov. 14. The work features 49 dead cedar trees Lin planted in a rebuke of deforestation. Keen to also offer solutions, she has planned a series of public programs (listed on the park conservancy\u2019s website) that focus on how we can help.MELISSA SMITH</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Celebrating the Return of Togetherness</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the past 25 years, the bassist William Parker and the dancer Patricia Nicholson Parker have presented free jazz concerts and interdisciplinary shows under the name Arts for Art, often not far from their home in the East Village.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s history around them in that neighborhood. Half a century ago, not long after a group of Abstract Expressionist painters there established the New York School, jazz improvisers living and playing nearby, like Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor, showed how expressionism could be a collective act, and how it might sound.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free jazz, as a Lower Manhattan tradition, has never fully gone away, and after a year and a half of dormancy, AFA returns to live presenting this weekend with free concerts at 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, at the First Street Green art space between First and Second Avenues. William Parker will perform each day alongside some of New York\u2019s best creative improvisers, including the saxophonist Darius Jones, the trombonist Steve Swell and the multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee.GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next Stop, Fun and Sun</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regardless of how you feel about public transportation these days, one railway adventure remains completely safe: the journey the New York Transit Museum will offer on Saturday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the institution has not yet reopened its headquarters, a decommissioned subway station in Brooklyn, it is still holding its annual family benefit, Party on Wheels, via a familiar high-speed mode of travel \u2014 the internet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This free virtual excursion (a $25 donation per family is suggested) will unfold on Zoom from noon to 1 p.m. Eastern time. After a short tour of vintage vehicles, including the oldest in the museum\u2019s collection \u2014 a 1904 Brooklyn Union Elevated car \u2014 the married duo Dan + Claudia Zanes will present a New York- and transit-themed concert and participate in a brief Q. and A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the folk melodies they will perform, the bluesy \u201cConey Island Avenue,\u201d inspires the concluding activity.

Now, from Friday through Aug. 26, around 30 features will get a chance to play indoors. Big Screen Summer: NYFF58 Redux will kick off at Film at Lincoln Center with Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201cSmall Axe\u201d anthology: \u201cLovers Rock\u201d (which opened the festival) will play throughout the month, and the other \u201cSmall Axe\u201d films (including \u201cMangrove\u201d and \u201cRed, White and Blue\u201d) will screen multiple times in the coming week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in June and in July, expect revivals like \u201cHopper/Welles\u201d (an extended dialogue between Dennis Hopper and Orson Welles, with Welles sometimes playing a character) and Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s \u201cFlowers of Shanghai.\u201d The program will also have some selections that weren\u2019t shown at all. The eight-hour \u201cThe Works and Days (of Tayoko Shiojiri in the Shiotani Basin)\u201d will run from July 16 to 22, and the 1973 Polish film \u201cThe Hourglass Sanatorium\u201d will play in August.BEN KENIGSBERG</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Turning Trauma Into Show Tunes</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stand-up Kelly Bachman went viral in October 2019 for how she adapted her act when she saw Harvey Weinstein in the audience. Millions watched the clip on Twitter, and Bachman has made the most of her moment, mounting the showcase \u201cRape Jokes by Survivors\u201d at the 2019 New York Comedy Festival and participating in \u201cHysterical,\u201d an FX on Hulu documentary released in March.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In between, she developed a musical comedy hour, \u201cRape Victims Are Horny Too,\u201d with Dylan Adler, a fellow assault survivor and comedian.

Moreover, the authors claim this thermal pollution can account for the \"unexplained\" winter warming over northern latitudes of Eurasia and North America continents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(Note: \"unexplained\" here means the difference between observed climate changes not accounted for by current state-of-the-art climate models.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's quite a claim. But how seriously should it be taken? In my opinion, it's much to do about not much, although the nature of this new possible contributor to climate change is interesting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To begin, what do we mean by thermal pollution, sometimes also called \"waste heat\"?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever we humans generate energy, such as through burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity at power plants, power automobiles, heat buildings, etc., etc., much of it is immediately dissipated as \"waste heat\" into the environment. The remaining \"usable\" energy eventually dissipates as heat into the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, in conventional automobile engines it's known that 70 percent of the energy produced from gasoline is dissipated directly to the atmosphere through the radiator and exhaust pipe. Only 30 percent of the energy is used to actually move the car, but even that is dissipated as heat through braking and road friction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same principle applies to any and all activities that convert fuel to energy (including nuclear power) and, thereby, contributes to thermal pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related: Nuclear power plant produces snow in southwest Pennsylvania</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study analyzes whether the magnitude and distribution of thermal pollution is sufficient to be a meaningful contributor to global and regional climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(Note: thermal pollution is distinct from the urban heat island effect where solar radiation is absorbed by man-made structures in large urban areas and re-radiated or transferred via conduction to the environment.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The authors find that, in total, the magnitude of the thermal pollution around the globe is very small (nearly negligible) in comparison to estimates of the influence of the \"greenhouse effect\" from rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But they, nevertheless, hypothesize that the heating can influence climate over large regions even well-removed from the source of the heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To test this hypothesis, they quantify the effects of the thermal pollution on regional climate (not surprisingly) using a climate model to evaluate the differences between simulations with and without representation of the heat energy. They find the model simulations that include the heat energy best match the observed climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this approach almost always (if not always, at this time) encounters the Achilles Heal of insufficient model resolution to be trustworthy at the regional level (e.g., over the Mid-Atlantic states). This is especially true with the specific model employed in this study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the experiment only uses this single model. No single model alone can ever be considered sufficient to estimate the effects and uncertainties of any potential contributor to climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, the results demonstrate a sensitivity in the regional climate to thermal pollution (see figures) as described. However, their significance in the real world is unsupported in the context of the reservations just mentioned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Furthermore, the authors do not provide an adequate explanation of the physical mechanisms attributable to the effects of the thermal pollution. The discussion of the systematic effects on the jet stream and ties to the supposed higher frequency of troughs (low pressure) and ridges (high pressure) along coastlines is far from convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My reservations about the methodology employed notwithstanding, some influence of thermal pollution on regional climate is plausible. And one cannot disagree with the authors that further study is warranted.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

Democratic lawmakers expect that the proposal could change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's a breakdown of what's in Mr. Biden's framework:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Healthcare</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal would extend beefed-up Affordable Care Act subsidies through 2025, but wouldn't make them permanent as many Democrats had initially hoped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would also help provide healthcare coverage to people currently without any in the 12 states that chose not to expand Medicaid. Democrats would make those people eligible for the expanded subsidies through 2025, but they would not start a new federal Medicaid program, as some in the party proposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal would expand Medicare to include hearing benefits, but not dental or vision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The framework doesn't include allowing Medicare to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. But congressional aides said there were ongoing discussions over the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The framework sets aside $555 billion for climate-related provisions, a top-line figure that the White House says is the largest such investment in history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate measures include $320 billion in 10-year expanded tax credits for utility-scale and residential renewable energy, transmission, electric vehicles and clean-energy manufacturing; $105 billion to boost resilience to the effects of climate change, like wildfires and droughts; $110 billion to grow U.S. supply chains for renewable energy technology; and $20 billion to incentivize the government to purchase cutting-edge energy technologies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Biden has been pushing for an agreement on the legislation ahead of his coming appearance at an international climate summit in Scotland, where world leaders are expected to press the U.S. about how it will meet a target of halving domestic greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House said the framework agreement would help the U.S. meet that target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement doesn't include measures opposed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), including a $150 billion program aimed at pushing utilities to generate more electricity from clean sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House didn't detail all of the climate provisions and Democrats were waiting to hear whether the framework also includes fossil fuel-related measures meant to appease Mr. Manchin.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Education and child care</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The framework includes a signature priority for Mr. Biden: federally funded preschool for all three- and four-year-olds in the U.S. The free preschool program is funded for six years, according to the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also seeks to lower the cost of child care for many Americans. Under the framework, families who make up to 250% of their home state's median income will spend no more than 7% of their income on child care. In order to qualify for the program, parents must be working, seeking work, in training or have a serious health condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal includes a one-year extension of a child tax credit that Democrats expanded as part of a Covid-19 relief package earlier this year. Childless workers would also be eligible for an expanded earned-income tax credit for an additional year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The framework doesn't include tuition-free community college , as Mr. Biden initially proposed. Instead, it increases the maximum size of Pell grants for college students, invests in workforce development programs and provides support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as other minority-led educational institutions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also not mentioned in the framework: paid family leave , a major priority for Mr. Biden and many Democrats. Mr. Manchin had raised concerns about the proposal, which was initially designed to last 12 weeks but had been slimmed down to four weeks. Several Senate Democrats said they were still fighting for the provision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taxes</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The major tax provisions would raise money from large corporations and high-income households.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 15% corporate minimum tax would affect companies that are profitable but report relatively low tax rates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S.-based multinational companies would face a different 15% minimum tax on their foreign income. They would pay at least 15% in each country in which they operate, as part of the U.S. participation in an international agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corporate stock buybacks would face a new 1% excise tax.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On individual income taxes, the plan includes a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income above $10 million and an additional 3% on adjusted gross income above $25 million. That would effectively raise the top tax rates on ordinary income and capital gains. Taxing adjusted gross income means that people affected by those surtaxes wouldn't be able to deduct charitable contributions and state and local taxes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>High-income business owners would face a 3.8% tax on active business income. Currently, levies of that amount are applied on their wages, self-employment income and investment income.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats also plan to roughly double the size of the IRS with an eye toward tougher enforcement of tax laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other tax ideas from Democrats weren't included, such as a new tax on billionaires' unrealized capital gains and a plan to require banks to report annual account flows to the Internal Revenue Service. Proposed changes to the corporate tax rate, the estate tax and trusts aren't mentioned in the framework and are likely not going to happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The framework doesn't specifically mention changes to the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, but Democratic lawmakers expect to relax or repeal that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other Provisions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Housing: The framework includes $150 billion for affordable housing, down from nearly $330 billion in the House Democrats' original proposal. The framework released by the White House would include $65 billion to repair public housing, $25 billion for rental assistance and $15 billion for the Housing Trust Fund, which provides grants to produce affordable housing, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The plan also includes down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers whose parents also don't own homes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Food aid: The framework includes funding to expand free school meals during the school year and a $65-per-child monthly benefit to help low-income families purchase food during the summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elder Care: The White House said the proposal helps older Americans and people with disabilities afford the care they need, but the framework doesn't provide details, aside from saying it strengthens a Medicaid care program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration: The framework sets aside $100 billion for immigration-related provisions, so long as the provisions fall within the Senate's existing rules for advancing legislation tied to the budget, known as reconciliation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are hoping to offer millions of immigrants a temporary form of deportation protection known as parole, which would allow them to work legally in the U.S. and could allow some immigrants with U.S. citizen family members to apply for green cards. Democrats haven't presented that option yet to the Senate parliamentarian, who determines what's allowed in reconciliation, Democratic aides familiar with the matter said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if the parliamentarian rules against the parole measure, the money will be spent to improve the immigration system in other ways, aides said. The money could be used to reduce green card and visa backlogs, offer unaccompanied children and other immigrants lawyers for their deportation proceedings, and hire more asylum officers to process migrants' claims at the border faster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Siobhan Hughes, Michelle Hackman and Nicole Friedman contributed to this article.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com , Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's $1.85 Trillion Budget Reconciliation Framework: What's In and What's Out?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Andrew Duehren, Kristina Peterson and Richard Rubin\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

As recently as last month, Trump called the agreement \"a total disaster\" and argued that the Obama administration's pledges to cut carbon emissions under the deal would have \"hurt the competitiveness\" of the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a statement Monday afternoon, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration had sent official notification of its plans to the United Nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In international climate discussions, we will continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model \u2014 backed by a record of real world results \u2014 showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy,\" Pompeo said. \"We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental and public health activists quickly condemned the decision, even as it came as no surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Abandoning the Paris agreement is cruel to future generations, leaving the world less safe and productive,\" Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement. \"It also fails people in the United States, who will lose out on clean energy jobs, as other nations grab the competitive and technological advantages that the low-carbon future offers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris climate agreement legally entered into force Nov. 4, 2016, after the United States and other countries formally joined the landmark deal. Under rules set out by the United Nations, no country could leave the accord for three years, after which there is a one-year waiting period for the withdrawal to fully take effect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday marked the first day that the Trump administration could give that one-year notice, and it wasted no time. That means the United States can now officially leave the Paris agreement Nov. 4, 2020 \u2014 the day after next year's presidential election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Should a Democrat win the White House, the nation could reenter the agreement after a short absence \u2014 as numerous candidates have pledged. But if Trump prevails, his reelection would probably cement the long-term withdrawal of the United States, which was a key force in helping forge the global effort under President Barack Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday's move comes as scientists say that the world must take \"unprecedented\" action to cut its carbon emissions over the next decade, slashing them in half by 2030 to avoid irreversible and potentially catastrophic effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world already has warmed more than about one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. The Paris agreement set ambitious goals to keep the planet's warming \"well below\" a rise of two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and if possible, not above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post analysis has found, however, that roughly one-tenth of the globe has already warmed by more than two degrees Celsius, when the past five years are compared with the mid- to late 1800s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday's action also comes only weeks after world leaders gathered at the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York as part of a push to encourage nations to make high-profile commitments to cut the emissions that fuel global warming. That event laid bare the tensions between a growing activist movement eager for more aggressive action and global leaders who have yet to commit to the transformational changes that scientists say are essential to averting the worst effects of climate change in coming decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The biggest cost is doing nothing,\" U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told the gathering. \"The biggest cost is subsidizing a dying fossil fuel industry, building more and more coal power plants and denying what is plain as day \u2014 that we are in a deep climate hole, and to get out, we must first stop digging.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a Rose Garden appearance June 1, 2017, Trump first announced plans to withdraw the nation from the Paris agreement, under which nearly 200 countries had made voluntary, nonbinding pledges to reduce their carbon emissions over time. He argued that the accord \"disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics have called Trump's dismissal of the Paris accord irresponsible and dangerous, given the increasingly dire scientific warnings about rising sea levels, more-extreme weather and devastating effects on agriculture and wildlife should the world fail to drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions. They also call the decision bad economic policy, saying the administration is failing to embrace wind, solar and other renewable technologies that are growing, even as the coal industry that Trump has tried to bolster continues to fade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"While the world will not be surprised, it's a sad reminder of where the world's former leader on climate change now stands,\" Susan Biniaz, a lecturer at Yale Law School and former State Department climate negotiator, said in an email about Monday's announcement. \"The decision of two years ago [to abandon the Paris accord] is now even more grotesque \u2014 the reasons for withdrawing are no more correct, and the science is even clearer that, far from withdrawing, we should be increasing our efforts.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A growing number of Americans describe climate change as a crisis, and two-thirds say Trump is doing too little to tackle the problem, according to a recent poll conducted by The Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The poll found that a large majority of Americans \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 say that human activity is fueling climate change, and about half believe action is urgently needed within the next decade if humanity is to avert its worst effects. Nearly 4 in 10 now say climate change is a \"crisis,\" up from less than a quarter five years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates joined environmental groups in blasting Trump's decision on Monday, the withdrawal won praise from some conservative corners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Free market innovation \u2014 not crippling global agreements \u2014 will help reduce global carbon emissions and address climate change,\" Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who in 2017 was among nearly two dozen GOP senators who had urged Trump to ditch the Paris accord, said in a statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even as world leaders have promised to forge ahead on climate action without the United States, progress has been slow and uneven.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The emissions-cutting pledges that countries unveiled in Paris were nowhere near sufficient to meet the goals detailed under the agreement \u2014 a reality world leaders have repeatedly acknowledged. The plan was for nations to ramp up their ambition over time. And while dozens of countries have signaled their intentions to do that over the coming year, it remains unclear whether it will be nearly enough to put the world on a more sustainable trajectory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Global emissions of carbon dioxide reached record-high levels in 2018, scientists said late last year, underscoring the gap between the world's aspirations for combating climate change and what countries are actually doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to aggressively roll back Obama-era environmental rules aimed at reducing carbon emissions, including regulations intended to accelerate the shift away from coal-fired power plants and steadily increase the fuel efficiency of the nation's auto fleet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the president has made clear that he views increasing fossil fuel production \u2014 not renewable energy and international climate agreements \u2014 as the more important priority for the nation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I've made that wealth come alive,\" Trump said during a news conference this summer in France. \"I'm not going to lose that wealth \u2014 I'm not going to lose it on dreams, on windmills.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carol Morello contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

So it was no trivial matter when a group of Rockefeller heirs decided recently to begin severing financial ties to fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There is a moral imperative to preserve a healthy planet,\" said Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, a great-great-granddaughter of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller Sr. and a trustee of the largest charitable foundation in which the family still plays the leading role.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the foundation, known as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, will formally announce plans to begin divesting itself of fossil-fuel stocks, citing concerns about climate change. The symbolic cutting of ties to a key part of the family's heritage is being timed with the start of another symbolism-laden event: a gathering of world leaders to grapple with the environmental consequences of decades of fossil-fuel burning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama will join heads of state from more than 120 countries Tuesday at an unusual climate summit convened by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The meeting in New York is aimed at persuading governments to do more to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the face of new evidence of an accelerating buildup of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The high-level gathering -- the biggest since a troubled round of international climate negotiations in Copenhagen five years ago -- is likely to underscore the diplomatic and political difficulties ahead as the governments seek to hammer out a treaty limiting global greenhouse-gas emissions by late next year. The Obama administration separately faces tough negotiations with overseas trading partners China and India over proposed cuts in fossil-fuel burning, while also defending its climate policies against attacks from Republican opponents in Washington.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the perception of halting progress on climate politics stands in sharp contrast with an increasingly energetic movement that will be on display on the summit's periphery. An unlikely coalition of groups -- including corporate executives, philanthropists and urban planners -- are in New York this week to showcase practical steps being implemented to address the causes of climate change and mitigate its effects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Entrepreneurs and businesses will promote technology breakthroughs that are making wind and solar power competitive with more traditional energy sources in some parts of the country. And investors and foundations with collective holdings in the tens of billions of dollars will formally join a global \"divest-invest\" movement that seeks to shift capital from fossil-fuel extraction to renewable energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New participants in the movement, such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, say their decision reflects not only concerns about the environment but also a belief that renewables are becoming an increasingly sound investment at a time of growing uncertainty about the future of fossil fuels such as coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The action we're taking is symbolism, but it is important symbolism,\" said Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which controls nearly $900 million in assets. \"We're making a moral case, but also, increasingly, an economic case.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The summit's formal events are playing out against a boisterous backdrop that includes thousands of activists and protesters. On Sunday, a crowd estimated by organizers at more than 300,000 marched through central Manhattan in what was believed to be the biggest climate-related demonstration ever held. The massive rally, which was mirrored by smaller protests in other cities around the globe, drew not only environmental activists but also college students, labor groups, A-list Hollywood celebrities such as actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, and politicians including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our mission is to make this a decisive moment and a turning-point moment, and I felt today that I was seeing history starting to be made,\" de Blasio told reporters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But several key names are missing from this week's summit. China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will be represented by its vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, rather than President Xi Jinping. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi likewise will skip the gathering, although he is expected to discuss climate change during an official visit to the White House this month. Several European governments are being represented by foreign ministers or other senior cabinet officers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The absences of the heads of state of some of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases has led skeptics of the U.N. climate treaty process to belittle the New York gathering as a meaningless exercise in public relations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"President Obama has pledged to be at the Summit. The leaders of China, India, Australia, Germany, Canada, among others, have better things to do,\" Patrick Michaels, a climatologist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, wrote in a blog post last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration is seeking to use the summit to showcase its achievements in reducing U.S. carbon emissions while publicly urging other countries to do more. The White House will tout efforts to raise fuel-economy standards for the automotive industry and reduce pollution from coal-burning utilities, as well as more recent, voluntary initiatives to encourage investment in solar energy and phase out production of the heat-trapping hydrofluorocarbons widely used in air conditioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are taking the summit seriously, both to show the world that the United States is committed to leading the fight against climate change and to call on other leaders to do the same,\" White House counselor John Podesta told reporters last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While acknowledging formidable challenges in international climate negotiations as well as from a skeptical Congress, administration officials say they plan a more aggressive push in the weeks ahead. Adding urgency, the officials said, are new scientific findings that show record growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, along with new evidence of changes in weather patterns and ocean chemistry. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that, despite unusually cool weather in the eastern United States, global average temperatures over the summer were the highest since detailed record-keeping began in the 1880s, putting 2014 on a track for being the hottest year in historical time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Across the country and around the world, people are grappling with drought and wildfires and severe weather,\" Podesta said. \"So we don't have time to dabble in climate denial.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The increased emphasis on climate change also reflects shifting political realities. While large majorities in Congress -- including nearly all Republicans and many leading Democrats -- have voiced opposition to binding international treaties on greenhouse-gas emissions, opinion polls have shown growing concern over climate change in a year in which the Northeast continues to repair the damage from 2012's Hurricane Sandy, while the country's western half wilts under epic heat and record droughts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The administration is beginning to see a large political opportunity as the GOP appears stuck in what I call 'climate nihilism,' \" said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate aide who is now a senior fellow on energy at the German Marshall Fund. \"On both political and policy grounds, they see a need to be aggressive and to prompt popular activism and international action.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shifting politics is partially a reflection of a transformation in the priorities and tactics of environmental groups leading the fight for more aggressive climate policies. Once dominated by legal, legislative and regulatory strategists, the major envi ronmental organizations have poured money into local politics while also attempting to broaden their base, encouraging people at local levels to engage in civil disobedience as well as fund-raising and legal action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The green movement was galvanized by the fight over the proposed Keystone Pipeline, as activists, led by Middlebury College professor Bill McKibben, seized on the controversy to mobilize college students and encourage divestment to block construction of the proposed conduit that would transfer crude from Canadian oil sands to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other major groups, such as the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have increasingly promoted citizen activism to protest coal-burning projects. On the electoral front, the League of Conservation Voters plans to spend $25 million in this election cycle, five times as much as than it did in the 2010 midterm elections, with much of the money going to state contests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Key industries also have shown increased sensitivity to climate politics, agreeing in some cases to work with the Obama administration in adopting voluntary curbs on emissions. On Monday, the State Department will trumpet an initiative that commits companies to taking further steps to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations. In the 10 months since State Department officials first approached energy firms about its Climate and Clean Air Coalition Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, six have agreed to take part, including Southwestern Energy, the fourth-largest U.S. natural gas producer, as well as the British firm BG Group and Norway's Statoil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We believe that it's much better that the companies are proactive,\" said Helge Lund, chief executive of Statoil. \"In that way, perhaps we'll be able to impact the direction so we can have as rational and market-based solutions as possible.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The recent decisions by energy firms and elite financial organizations have helped reinforce perceptions of a cultural shift, even though the divest movement has not significantly altered the course of big oil and gas companies that remain convinced that the increasing appetite for energy in rapidly developing nations will outpace any increase in renewable energy. Still, on the eve of the U.N. summit, leaders of the divest-invest initiative prepared to release a long list of new participants in a campaign that now includes 180 institutions and local governments as well as nearly 700 individuals, collectively representing $50 billion in assets. Billionnaire hedgefund manager Tom Steyer will formally join the movement on Monday, sources familar with the decision said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the many additions, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund stood out because of historical ties to one of the world's great oil empires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wayne, the Rockefeller descendant now on the fund's board of trustees, said her foundation would first divest its assets from industries involved in coal and tar-sands mining, followed by a more gradual disengagement from other fossil-fuel stocks. Some family members continue to hold stock in Exxon Mobil -- a modern descendant of the Standard Oil company co-founded by her great-great-grandfather in the 1870s -- and several have used their status as shareholders to launch proxy campaigns to encourage the company to adopt more environmentally friendly policies, Wayne said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is part of a natural progression for us,\" said Wayne, who marched Sunday with her three children in the pre-summit demonstration in New York.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wayne said she felt certain that her famous ancestor would approve. In their lifetimes, both the Standard Oil founder and his son, the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., were ardent supporters of conservation causes, purchasing huge swaths of ranch land and donating them to the federal government to create some of America's first wilderness preserves for future generations to enjoy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the elder Rockefeller were alive today, she said, he would be \"investing in alternative energy sources and renewables right now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>joby.warrick@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steven.mufson@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Joby Warrick;Steven Mufson\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Its islandwide species diversity is striking, but its tropical forest biodiversity is truly exceptional.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, human activities are ravaging tropical forests worldwide. Habitat fragmentation, over-harvesting of wood and other forest products, over-hunting, invasive species, pollution and climate change are depleting many of these forests' native species.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among these threats, climate change receives special attention because of its global reach. But in my research, I have found that in Madagascar it is not the dominant reason for species decline, although of course it's an important long-term factor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a primatologist and lemur specialist, I study how human pressures affect Madagascar's highly diverse and endemic signature species. In two recent studies, colleagues and I have found that, in particular, the ruffed lemur \u2014 an important seed disperser and indicator of rainforest health \u2014 is being disproportionately affected by human activities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Importantly, habitat loss is driving ruffed lemurs' distributions and genetic health. These findings will be key to helping to save them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Madagascar has lost nearly half (44 percent) of its forests within the past 60 years, largely because of slash-and-burn agriculture \u2014 known locally as \"tavy\" \u2014 and charcoal production. Habitat loss and fragmentation runs throughout Madagascar's history, and the rates of change are staggering.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This destruction threatens Madagascar's biodiversity and its human population. Nearly 50\u00a0percent of the country's remaining forest is now within 300 feet of an unforested area. Deforestation, illegal hunting and collection for the pet trade are pushing many species toward the brink of extinction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that 95 percent of Madagascar's lemurs are threatened, making them the world's most endangered mammals. Pressure on Madagascar's biodiversity has significantly increased over the past decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a newly published study, climate scientist Toni Lyn Morelli, species distribution expert Adam Smith and I worked with 19 other researchers to study how deforestation and climate change will affect two critically endangered ruffed lemur species over the next century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Using combinations of different deforestation and climate change scenarios, we estimate that suitable rainforest habitat could be reduced by as much as 93 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If left unchecked, deforestation alone could effectively eliminate ruffed lemurs' entire eastern rainforest habitat and, with it, the animals themselves. For these lemurs, the effects of forest loss will outpace climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we also found that if current protected areas lose no more forest, climate change and deforestation outside of parks will reduce suitable habitat by only 62 percent. This means that maintaining and enhancing the integrity of protected areas will be essential for saving Madagascar's rainforest habitats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a study published in November, my colleagues and I showed that ruffed lemurs depend on habitat cover to survive. We investigated natural and human-caused impediments that prevent the lemurs from spreading across their range, and tracked the movement of their genes as they ranged between habitats and reproduced. This movement, known as gene flow, is important for maintaining genetic variability within populations, allowing lemurs to adapt to their ever-changing environments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Based on this analysis, we parsed out which landscape variables \u2014 including rivers, elevation, roads, habitat quality and human population density \u2014 best explained gene flow in ruffed lemurs. We found that human activity was the best predictor of ruffed lemurs' population structure and gene flow. Deforestation alongside human communities was the most significant barrier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taken together, these and other lines of evidence show that deforestation poses an imminent threat to conservation on Madagascar. Based on our projections, habitat loss is a more immediate threat to lemurs than climate change, at least in the immediate future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This matters not only for lemurs but also for other plants and animals in the areas where lemurs are found. The same is true at the global level: More than one-third (about 36.5 percent) of Earth's plant species are exceedingly rare and disproportionately affected by human use of land. Regions where the most rare species live are experiencing higher levels of human impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists have warned that the fate of Madagascar's rich natural heritage hangs in the balance. Results from our work suggest that strengthening protected areas and reforestation efforts will help to mitigate this devastation while environmentalists work toward long-term solutions for curbing the runaway greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, nonprofit groups are working hard toward these goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A partnership between Edward E. Louis Jr., founder of Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and director of Conservation Genetics at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo, and the Arbor Day Foundation's Plant Madagascar project has replanted nearly 3 million trees throughout Kianjavato, one region identified by our study. Members of Centre ValBio's reforestation team \u2014 a nonprofit organization based outside of Ranomafana National Park that aids in our ruffed lemur research \u2014 are following suit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At an international conference in Nairobi last year, Madagascar's president, Andry Rajoelina, promised to reforest 99,000 acres every year for the next five years \u2014 the equivalent of 75,000 football fields. This commitment, while encouraging, unfortunately lacks a coherent implementation plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our projections highlight areas of habitat persistence, as well as areas where ruffed lemurs could experience near-complete habitat loss or genetic isolation in the not-so-distant future.

That's one conclusion of research we recently published in Nature Plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We first became curious about barley, and the beer it produces, as this relatively minor crop was clearly affected by climate extremes yet had never caught the attention of climate scientists. And unlike many other food crops, barley grown for beer is required to meet very specific quality parameters. Malted barley gives beer much of its flavor, yet if it is too hot or there isn't enough water during critical growing stages, the malt cannot be extracted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is why we gathered a team of scientists based in China, the U.K. and the U.S. to assess what extreme drought and heat events may mean for beer supplies and prices. We were interested specifically in what would happen to barley when there was both extreme drought and heat during the growing season, something that will become more common thanks to global warming. We then modeled what this would mean for barley yields in 34 world regions which either produce or drink a lot of beer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In more optimistic scenarios, where emissions are brought under control and warming is kept at a manageable level (what climate scientists refer to as RCP2.6), droughts and heat waves might occur together in about 4 percent of the years. In the worst-case scenario, where emissions and temperatures keep increasing, such extremes might occur in 31 percent of the years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are global average results, however, which can hide significant regional variation. In affected years, barley yields would drop the most in tropical areas of Central and South America, and in Central Africa, for instance. In the same years, yields in temperate Europe would decrease moderately, or even increase in parts of the U.S. or Russia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the overall trend is clear: At a global level, barley yields will at best \u2014 under the optimistic scenario \u2014 decrease by 3 percent. And in the worst-case scenario, yields will fall 17 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We know that climate change will mean less barley \u2014 but what about beer? One factor to consider is that barley is mostly used to feed livestock, and beer is ultimately more dispensable than meat. This means that declining yields will hit beer production extra hard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, our modeling suggests that during the most severe climate events, the price of beer would double and global consumption would decline by 16 percent, or 29 billion liters. That is roughly equal to the total annual beer consumption of the U.S. Even under the optimistic scenario of less extreme climate change, beer consumption would still drop by 4 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Again, price and consumption changes would vary widely from country to country, with the greatest price increases being concentrated in relatively affluent and historically beer-loving countries. In Ireland, for example, the price of a beer bottle would double under extreme climate change. In less wealthy countries, people would simply drink less beer under those circumstances. We predict a 32 percent drop in Argentina, for example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is possible that more drought- or heat-tolerant barley cultivars may be developed in future, which would reduce the risk of climate change to supplies of beer. But these and other technological developments, or increases in stockpiling (or even prioritizing beer over livestock), were beyond the scope of our study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While previous research has looked in detail at what climate change means for essentials like wheat or rice, less attention has been paid to so-called \"luxury goods.\" In our study, we took beer as one such example, to highlight the ways climate change will affect our lives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We hope our results might attract further attention from various beer-lovers who actually have the power to do something about global warming. Seeing that climate change is affecting our lives in more ways than we imagined before, they might start to think about further strengthening global efforts to reduce emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article is republished from</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Conversation</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>under a Creative Commons license.

Kern County, which now produces 70 percent of California\u2019s oil, considers a future with no fossil fuel extraction. Plus, a dog helps rescue its owner in a California forest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long a leader in environmental regulation, California is considering phasing out oil drilling in the state by 2045 as part of an effort to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our state\u2019s economy isn\u2019t heavily dependent on fossil fuels the way the economies of, say, West Virginia or Oklahoma are. But ending oil production here would still pose a major challenge for at least one pocket of the Golden State.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About a two-hour drive north of Los Angeles is Kern County, our very own oil country. Kern County produces 70 percent of the state\u2019s oil. The industry there is responsible for 16,000 jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, most crucially, oil and gas generate nearly one-quarter of the county\u2019s property tax revenue, which pays for schools, law enforcement, hospitals and other public services. \u201cNowhere else in California is tied to oil and gas the way we are, and we can\u2019t replace what that brings overnight,\u201d the county\u2019s chief administrative officer, Ryan Alsop, told The New York Times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My colleague Brad Plumer recently traveled to Kern County and wrote about its struggle to quit oil drilling, even in a state so dedicated to reducing its carbon footprint. Kern County offers a glimpse into issues that other communities across the U.S. could face as they also try to disentangle themselves from fossil fuel income.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem boils down to this: If California ends oil drilling, Kern County needs another source of revenue to keep its roads paved and libraries open. Some have suggested leaning into renewables, as the county is already the state\u2019s largest provider of wind and solar power. Local leaders are also discussing expanding industries like aerospace, manufacturing, hydrogen or biodiesel production, or even carbon capture technology.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cPoliticians, businesses, environmentalists, academics \u2014 everyone\u2019s sort of thinking hard about how can the county reinvent itself,\u201d Brad told me. \u201cBut all of these strategies take time, and they might take longer than the county has if the state is serious about phasing out oil production so quickly.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Kern County waits until the tax revenue and jobs dry up, it will most likely become harder to attract new businesses. People won\u2019t want to put down roots in a place that\u2019s struggling to fund its parks, Police Department or social services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many examples of places that have had trouble bouncing back after their main industry disappeared, including coal communities in West Virginia, and towns in the Rust Belt after the decline of heavy industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One model for Kern County could be Tonawanda, a town in western New York that lost millions in tax revenue after a coal plant closed in 2015. The New York State Legislature helped replace the funds, and the town is now looking to redevelop its waterfront and expand industries like tire manufacturing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has already proposed $65 million to support and retrain displaced oil and gas workers in the state, $200 million to clean up abandoned wells and $450 million to help communities diversify their economies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s possible the state will commit more as the end of oil drilling draws nearer, but it remains unclear how that money should best support Kern County, Brad said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt does seem that the state is very much aware of this problem, and they seem sympathetic to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really hard challenge, and no one really has a perfect template for what exactly you do.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rest of the news</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eviction help: Thousands of California tenants lose their homes every year because they fail to submit an initial answer in court after receiving an eviction notice.

I belong to a canoe club and we get a group of people together to camp along the river for two nights and we paddle three days. The second night, we camp at a place called Basin Creek. It is one of the most lovely places I have ever been. A small creek spills out of a hilly area. It has carved into the solid rock a series of five or six small basins \u2014 the largest might be four feet deep and a bit larger than a kiddie pool. The tallest waterfall is 15 feet. It is an intimate place with room for only two people. It\u2019s a difficult clamber to get to where the mossy walls share the cracks and crannies with small wildflowers and ferns. If the main river canyon is windy and harsh, this little creek is funny and peaceful. The icy cold water seems to giggle its way down each small drop. Even when the Eel River is low because of the summer drought, Basin Creek has some water to fill each little basin.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.

That figure is more than double the 398,000 currently estimated to be at risk, based on new maps the Federal Emergency Management Agency released Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more businesses and jobs will also be at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The data was released a day before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was to issue a report on how the city can better prepare for major weather events, including those like Hurricane Sandy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administration officials said that between 1971 and 2000, New Yorkers had an average of 18 days a year with temperatures at or above 90 degrees. By the 2020s, that figure could be as high as 33 days, and by the 2050s, it could reach 57, according to data collected by the New York City Panel on Climate Change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The panel, formed in 2008 to assist in PlaNYC, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s sustainability initiative, presented its findings in 2009.

They were revised in 2007, but had used data from 1983. In an attempt to help people rebuild, FEMA released new advisory maps in January.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But those maps drew protests because they more than doubled the number of structures included within flood-prone areas, to 70,000 in New York City (out of a total of nearly one million structures), making people vulnerable to sharp flood insurance rate hikes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The maps released on Monday slightly reduce that number of affected structures, to 67,700.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to the maps, which face an approval process of roughly 18 months, the most significant increase in flood-prone properties occurred in Brooklyn, where 25,800 structures are now considered at risk, up 253 percent.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

But the White House objected to their inclusion, Democrats said, so they were pulled from the final deal to avoid a government shutdown before the holidays.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're missing a huge opportunity,\" said Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), chair of the House and Commerce subcommittee on climate change and the environment. \"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.\" Tonko had led more than 160 House Democrats urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in an open letter in October to \"prioritize\" including the clean energy tax credits in the final spending deal with Republicans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In particular, the oil and natural gas industry, a major ally of President Trump, vigorously lobbied against an expansion of a tax break for buyers of cars that need little to no gasoline to run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats say the Trump administration decided to side with the oil sector over General Motors and other automakers, which had mounted their own campaign in Congress this year to save the dwindling tax credit for electric vehicles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House, said Rep. Dan Kildee, \"made it very clear that everything but electric vehicles is on the table.\" The Michigan Democrat added that Trump \"fell flat\" in protecting Midwestern auto manufactures by refusing to subsidize the sale of low- to no-emissions cars. Elsewhere, the spending bill was filled to the brim with tax relief for everything from beer breweries and whiskey distilleries\u00a0to\u00a0churches with parking lots\n.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The package did fulfill one major Democratic demand: Sustaining funding at energy and environmental agencies. The spending bill boosts funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by $208 million and increases funding for basic scientific research at the Energy Department by $415 million, despite efforts by the White House to slash spending within the two departments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the final package does have a handful of provisions supporting alternative energy. Tax credits for biodiesel fuel, energy-efficiency projects and some wind turbines were extended. The bill also revived several expired tax breaks for geothermal, electric scooters and some other technologies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet some of the tax breaks are retroactive, which means they do little to nothing to incentivize more investment in clean energy now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greg Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, in particular lamented the loss of tax breaks for energy storage projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cost of wind and solar power have dropped a lot, but those sources of power often generate electricity when consumers don't need it. Big batteries and other ways of storing energy helped solve the problem, but those technologies are still expensive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's an ideal, prototypical situation for a tax incentive,\" Wetstone said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond energy and environmental policy, Democrats point to a grab bag of victories on issues in the legislation that motivate their voting base. It would provide funding for gun research and stabilize pensions for tens of thousands of miners after a string of bankruptcies among coal-mining firms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tax bill comes off the heels of a deal last week between Democrats and Trump on a new North American trade pact \u2014 a major priority for the president \u2014 that also contained little that reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With many environmentalists livid over a lack of wins for them as the year closes, the fallout from the failure to give tax relief for renewable energy producers could extend to the ballot box in 2020.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Brune, head of the Sierra Club, a usually staunch environmental ally for Democrats based in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) hometown of San Francisco, even threatened on Twitter to challenge sitting House Democrats in primaries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You are reading \nThe Energy 202\n, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 More from the spending bill:\u00a0The massive spending package also boosts funding to battle wildfires, delivering a legislative win for California and other Western states still recovering from multiple seasons of damaging blazes. The measure increases funding used to fight fires by $1.9 billion over the previous year. The deal also \"ends a long-standing practice known as 'fire-borrowing,' which required the Forest Service to raid its other funds whenever it ran out of money to pay for fighting wildfires,\" the Los Angeles Time reports. \" \u2026 If Congress approves the spending package, the Forest Service will be able to withdraw money from a FEMA emergency fund during especially severe fire seasons, just as the government does for hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Legal battle over this bird heads to the 9th Circuit: Interior Department officials have asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a decision by a federal judge to temporarily halt the government's rule that changes the 2015 Obama-era policy protecting the greater sage grouse. U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill had determined federal scientists had not done enough analysis on impacts on the bird.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In addition to appealing the preliminary injunction to the 9th Circuit, Interior is also challenging Winmill's order denying the government's motion to dismiss for improper venue, or to allow the claims to be heard in a different court,\" E&E News reports. \"\u2026Sarah Stellberg, a staff attorney for Advocates for the West, said the environmental groups opposing the Trump administration's sage grouse plan had expected the government to challenge Winmill's ruling.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 One step closer to another national park: The massive defense bill the Senate sent to the president's desk on Tuesday includes language to designate the White Sands National Park in southern New Mexico.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The site became a national monument in 1933. The new designation through the NDAA \"includes a land exchange with the Department of Defense to better safeguard the missile range which borders the monument,\" according to the National Wildlife Federation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who introduced the measure along with Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.), praised the passage of the measure and said the new designation will be a \"major boon to the whole region's economy.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 House bill looks to address emissions from public lands: Democratic lawmakers from the House Natural Resources Committee introduced a sweeping bill that aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from public lands by 2040. The American Public Lands and Waters Climate Solution Act is \"one of the most aggressive climate bills that's been introduced in the current Congress,\" Vox reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>: The bill \"starts with a year-long pause on new fossil fuel leases. During this time, the Interior Department and the US Forest Service would have to craft a strategic plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>: \"By transitioning away from coal, oil, gas extraction and making our public lands and waters pollution-free by 2040, we will add a major contribution to combat climate change, protect our current and future generations from the greatest consequential challenge and threat we face, which is climate change,\" Chairman Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said during a news conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Government responsible for flooded homes during Harvey: A U.S. judge has ruled the federal government is liable for up to $1 billion in flood-related damage for thousands of homes and businesses in the Houston area that flooded during 2017's Hurricane Harvey. That's because those structures were built \"within an upstream area U.S. Army Corps of Engineers knew would be flooded by overflows from the Addicks and Barker reservoirs during an extreme storm,\" Bloomberg News\u00a0reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>: \"The judge ruled the government illegally stored floodwater on private property without the landowners' permission, in violation of the Takings Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment,\" per the report. \"The Takings Clause prohibits the government from using private property for public use without just compensation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the EPA watchdog criticized federal and state agencies' post-Harvey response: The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Inspector General found in a report out this week that the agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality failed to appropriately respond to air pollution concerns during Harvey. In the days after the storm hit Houston, petrochemical and other facilities released toxic chemicals into the air, but state and federal regulators did not keep track of air quality, Grist reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The report found that the EPA and TCEQ did not collect data when emissions of numerous carcinogenic chemicals were at their peak.

According to the latest report from the IEA, coal use will \"decline slightly this year but then stay steady through 2024,\" E&E News reports. \"\u2026Public opposition to coal is growing, major investors are thinking twice, natural gas and renewables are booming, and a few countries have even pledged to go coal-free, but the world consumes more of the fossil fuel now than it did before the 2015 Paris Agreement.\" The report adds: \"Expectations of an imminent coal collapse have come and gone before.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coming Up</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee holds hearings to examine the impacts of wildfire on electric grid reliability and efforts to mitigate wildfire risk and increase grid resiliency on Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Environment holds a hearing on the economic effects of climate change on Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Take a look back at some of the Post graphics team's favorite projects of the year: The Post's Tim Meko shared his maps of natural disasters across the United States.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

Local governments declaring emergencies and advising people to stay indoors. Many coughing and spitting, their lungs clogged with irritating particles of dust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For almost everyone who lives and works in the Amazon \u2014 as well for environmental activists around the globe \u2014 the fires are considered an unmitigated disaster, not only posing immediate health threats but also devastating huge swaths of a forest that plays an essential role in soaking up carbon dioxide and helping to keep global temperatures from rising further.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For a very select few, however, the smoke is the smell of money: Many of the these fires were started by ranch owners, a powerful force in the Brazilian economy, as a way to clear land for more grazing for their gigantic cattle herds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 200 million heads of cattle are raised in Brazil, with an estimated 173,746 square miles of forest converted to cattle pasture over recent decades, according to the Yale School of Forestry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts blame cattle ranching for up to 80 percent of the Amazon\u2019s deforestation in recent years, which has led to international environmental campaigns to pressure meatpackers to forsake purchasing cattle from ranches involved in such burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fires are a fast, and illegal, way to transform dense jungles into fields fit for grazing. Limited enforcement \u2014 and fines that when levied are rarely paid \u2014 make the risk-reward calculation of setting a blaze an easy one for the owners of large ranches, who typically live in cities hundreds of miles away from the smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The owners of smaller spreads, who actually live on their farms, are less likely to engage in new acts of large-scale burning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lenaldo Batista Oliveira, 63, a small ranch owner in Par\u00e1 State, said he has seen many fires over the years from the kitchen porch of his wooden shack as he takes breaks from tending to his 100 head of cattle. But he said he is becoming increasingly disturbed by the number of blazes he now witnesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey think they can burn as much as they want,\u201d he complained of his larger and more influential neighbors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the cowboys and ranch hands who work the land for meager salaries, feelings about the fires are mixed, with some adamantly opposed to the practice, while others experience them as a necessary evil to stay employed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe wake up without being able to breathe properly,\u201d said Roberto Carlos da Silva, a 48-year-old worker at a carefully groomed ranch named Fazenda Nossa Senhora in Par\u00e1 State. \u201cOpening up more land for the cattle only helps the rich. The poor only suffer from putting up with the smoke while they work hard putting out the fires.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A half mile away, a blaze was spreading across a field. Workers at Fazenda Nossa Senhora insisted that the fire had spread from another ranch.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miguel Pereira, a 52-year-old cowhand on the ranch, said he did not like the smoke from such blazes either, but he had a different take from Mr. da Silva, his co-worker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you only protect the environment, then the farmers will go under from all the pressure of their expenses,\u201d he said, while blue macaws shrieked as they fluttered around some shade trees. \u201cIf you can\u2019t deforest a little, then there is no way you can raise more cattle. You need to create a situation where it\u2019s good for both sides.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are government regulations that monitor and regulate deforestation by cattlemen and others, but they are haphazardly administered at best, with attempts at enforcement strained by the vastness and remoteness of the Amazon rainforest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Policing the Amazon has become even less of a priority since the January inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who has put economic development ahead of environmental concerns. Many ranchers and farmers have viewed this stance as a green light to burn more rainforest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s not to say there are no consequences for the ranchers who orchestrate these blazes. Brazil\u2019s three largest meatpackers have all committed to not buying any cattle directly from farms using illegally deforested land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is an enormous loophole around this promise: Cattle are frequently \u201claundered\u201d in the supply chain, often born on a farm where the forest was illegally cleared, and fattened on another ranch recently formed by a fire, before being sold to a final ranch that abides by Brazilian law and international environmental conventions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the beef produced is consumed domestically, although there are substantial exports, especially to China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some laundering relies on middlemen to sell animals to the meatpackers, it can also take place within a single farming operation. Ranchers are known to move cows among their own properties and then submit paperwork to meatpackers listing only the name of the facility where their cattle are raised on permissible land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Fazenda Nossa Senhora, a large property with 1,000 head of cattle, on one side of fencing there is land where cattle raising is permitted under a 2009 agreement between the major meatpackers and Greenpeace to halt deforestation \u2014 but not on the other side of the fence because of burning there in recent years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several people who live and work on the farm nonchalantly reported that cattle amble back and forth across the fence all the time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe cattle need to change pasture,\u201d said Mr. Pereira, the cowhand. \u201cWhen the grass on one side gets used up, you have to take the cattle to the other side.\u2019\u2019</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ranch owners who say they do not burn new forest feel their profits are being pinched and are frustrated by the regulations against deforestation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019m losing money because they won\u2019t let me clear more trees,\u201d said Valdemar Gamba, whose family owns Fazenda Gramado II, a 370-acre ranch with 200 head of cattle. \u201cThey talk so much about conserving the Amazon, but I\u2019ve never seen a producer earn any money from this conservation.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever their stance on climate change and conservation, cattlemen are feeling the effects of a warming planet, and they worry about how all the burning is making life harder for them, and their animals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe live off the trees and the weather is getting hotter because there are fewer trees,\u201d said Luis Rodriguez, a 53-year-old cowhand who looks after the 350-head herd at the Fazenda Universal ranch in Par\u00e1 State. \u201cEven the cattle are suffering because it\u2019s getting dryer.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mariana Simoes contributed reporting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mariana Simoes contributed reporting.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Environmentalists fear that the production and processing of the gas for export could upend the province\u2019s aggressive climate change policies, which include an emissions-reduction goal and an unusual carbon tax system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If facilities to export the gas are built, they \u201cwill make it virtually impossible for British Columbia to meet its greenhouse gas targets,\u201d said Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia. For a province that has been a leader on climate change issues, she added, \u201cthat\u2019s a huge change of direction.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is difficult to know exactly how British Columbia\u2019s natural gas boom will affect its climate goals and policies, although the province\u2019s government has promised to develop the resource in the most environmentally friendly way possible. What is clear is that British Columbia is a case study of competing priorities \u2014 determination to battle climate change on the one hand, and eagerness to take advantage of a job-creating energy bonanza on the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six years ago, when the province began imposing a carbon tax, no drilling boom was in sight. The comprehensive tax was the first of its kind in North America, and environmentalists have hailed it as a relative success because greenhouse gas emissions fell after it was enacted, although other factors such as an economic slowdown were also at work. The province also established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33 percent from 2007 levels by 2020, although Dr. Harrison said the objective was \u201cnot on track.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after the climate moves came into effect, a drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing unearthed new deposits of natural gas in British Columbia. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, deploys a mix of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to release gas or oil trapped in rocks. Soon, the province\u2019s fields began producing copious amounts of gas, and production rose about 40 percent from 2008 to 2013. But drillers had trouble selling the gas to one of their mainstay markets, the United States, because of a parallel American gas boom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So British Columbia began looking to export its surplus to Asia. Eager buyers are at hand. China, which is struggling with air pollution, is eager to find substitutes for coal in its power plants, and Japan wants replacements for nuclear power. Large companies lined up to build multibillion-dollar gas export facilities in the province. Thirteen such facilities are now planned, according to the provincial government, but not all are likely to be built.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drillers say that the world should welcome the boom, partly because it will help China move away from coal, which burns less cleanly than natural gas. Environmentalists counter that the calculus is more complex, because natural gas could take the place of renewable energy that nations like China and Japan also want to build.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists also warn of leaks from natural gas production and pipeline facilities, which can send the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere. Industry representatives say that British Columbia\u2019s standards for reducing methane releases are already high.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much debate in British Columbia centers on the 13 facilities planned to export natural gas. These facilities transform natural gas into a liquid so the fuel can fit compactly onto ships. The process of liquefying the gas has two basic parts, according to Tom Rufford, a lecturer at the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Queensland in Australia. First, the facilities remove contaminants such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, butane and water. Then, acting like giant refrigerators, they cool the gas to minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit so that it becomes liquid. The liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., then gets loaded into tanks for transport.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plants that liquefy the gas are generally powered by natural gas. The energy needed to remove contaminants and liquefy the gas can amount to roughly 10 percent of the energy contained in the gas produced by the plant, Dr. Rufford said. He added that the facilities were \u201cvery efficient to start with, compared to some other industrial processes,\u201d like coal-fired power plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some environmental groups in British Columbia, such as Clean Energy Canada, want the facilities that liquefy the gas to use electricity derived largely from wind farms and local hydroelectric facilities for power, instead of mechanical energy and electricity from on-site natural gas-fired turbines. One relatively small proposed facility, called Woodfibre L.N.G., plans to use grid electricity rather than gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some in the industry say that using grid electricity \u2014 which in British Columbia is largely made from hydropower \u2014 is impractical. Greg Kist, president of Pacific NorthWest L.N.G., a proposed $11 billion liquefaction facility majority owned by the Malaysian oil and gas giant Petronas, said his project planned to use gas, rather than electric power from the grid, because of the substantial energy requirements of the plant and the time frame in which power is needed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere\u2019s very limited sources of power at that scope and scale in order to provide power for the facility,\u201d he said. His plant would process natural gas that is relatively free of contaminants like carbon dioxide \u2014 one of several measures that will save energy, he said. The facility could begin construction next year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich Coleman, British Columbia\u2019s deputy premier and minister of natural gas development, was unavailable for an interview. But a ministry representative said in an email that the province\u2019s carbon tax leadership would guide its decisions on liquefied natural gas. \u201cThe province is working to ensure B.C.\u2019s L.N.G. operations are the cleanest in the world. Discussions are taking place with industry now to make this a reality.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists are skeptical. A report last year from Clean Energy Canada estimated that typical liquefied natural gas facilities in British Columbia would produce almost three times as much carbon pollution per unit of liquefied gas as a facility in Norway and another in Australia, which the report cited as global leaders. (The figures include the production and piping of natural gas as well as the process of turning it into a liquid.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But gas producers say that British Columbia\u2019s carbon policies will influence their efforts. \u201cI think B.C. is and will continue to be a leader in many aspects of environmental policy,\u201d said Dave Collyer, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Natural gas, he said, would fit into that framework.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

That is why they have gathered in Glasgow this week, and it also why John Kerry, the Biden administration\u2019s climate czar, called the summit the \u201clast best hope for the world to get its act together.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how\u2019s the world doing? Here\u2019s what people are saying about how to think about the summit, what \u201csuccess\u201d there might look like and what the implications will be for global climate politics if it isn\u2019t achieved.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How many more degrees?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Global temperatures have already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. A decade ago, the world was on pace to warm by a total of 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, an outcome widely seen as catastrophic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But over the past 10 years, greenhouse gas emissions have been falling in many countries, including the United States. As a result, the end-of-the-century projection now hovers around 3 degrees of warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere has been a genuine shift over the past decade,\u201d Niklas H\u00f6hne, a German climatologist, told The Times\u2019s Brad Plumer and Nadja Popovich. \u201cYou can say that progress has been too slow, that it\u2019s still not enough, and I agree with all that. But we do see real movement.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason for much of the movement is technological:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A decade ago, solar panels and wind turbines were too expensive for mass use, but costs plummeted far faster than predicted.As clean energy alternatives have become cost-competitive and political pressure has intensified, countries have started to phase out coal power, a major source of emissions, albeit at a halting pace.In 2015, electric vehicles were barely available in the United States.

Today, the auto industry is betting its future on them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But scientists say the current trajectory is still nothing to celebrate. The United Nations climate science body recently warned that at sustained global warming levels between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, which together hold enough water to raise global sea levels nearly 40 feet, could melt irreversibly for thousands of years until they virtually disappear. That would condemn future generations to a relentless rise in sea levels that would sink many of the world\u2019s great coastal cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>[\u201c\u2018Bad For Humans\u2019: The World Is On Track To Warm 3 Degrees Celsius This Century\u201d]</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To avoid such scenarios, Fred Pearce notes at Yale Environment 360, it is not enough for world leaders to keep promising net-zero emissions by 2050. They will have to take much more ambitious steps to slash their emissions by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least 140 countries did make new commitments before Glasgow to do so. But even if countries follow through on these new commitments \u2014 and that\u2019s a big if \u2014 the world could still warm by about 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100. That is well beyond both the 2 degree limit enshrined in the Paris climate agreement and its aspirational target of 1.5 degrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe good news is that the 2050 net-zero targets for the first time put the \u2018well below\u2019 2 degrees and 1.5 limits of the Paris agreement within reach,\u201d H\u00f6hne told Pearce. \u201cBut the bad news is that no single country is on target to implement the short-term 2030 policies needed to be on track to meet their own net-zero targets.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Can diplomacy solve the climate free-rider problem?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Foreign Affairs, the economist William Nordhaus argued last month that international climate policy has failed in part because of what economists call the \u201cfree rider\u201d problem: The benefits of reducing emissions are broadly shared, but the costs \u2014 including, crucially, profits lost by leaving fossil fuels in the ground \u2014 are nationally borne, which incentivizes countries to rely, or free-ride, on others to take action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>[\u201cNot one single country on earth is willing to stop extracting fossil fuels\u201d]</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to climate change, not all free riders are created equal. Today, the Group of 20 \u2014 19 countries and the European Union that represent most of the world\u2019s economic output \u2014 accounts for 80 percent of the world\u2019s yearly emissions. Assign national responsibility for every ton of greenhouse gas that humans have put in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, and the tally becomes even starker: One-quarter came from the United States, a share that\u2019s slightly larger than the E.U.\u2019s and about twice as large as China\u2019s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because of this historical \u201cclimate debt,\u201d many lower-income countries say their actions will depend on those of richer countries. Especially after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement, many world leaders were eager to see President Biden come to Glasgow having secured some legislative achievement that matched his rhetoric on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Biden has no such achievement in hand: His own party has pared back his climate plan working its way through Congress, stripping the legislative sticks meant to draw down the use of fossil fuels and leaving only carrots for the deployment of emissions-free energy. Those carrots could still \u201cprobably get us close\u201d to Biden\u2019s climate pledges, The Atlantic\u2019s Robinson Meyer writes, but passage is far from guaranteed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>[\u201cThe U.S. Is Not a Climate Leader\u201d]</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aid is another factor at play. In 2009, rich countries pledged to give $100 billion a year to help poor countries address climate change, but they haven\u2019t kept their promise. Diplomats from Canada and Germany last week expressed \u201cconfidence\u201d the goal would be met in 2023.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But after a decade of inaction, that goal may now be out of date. \u201c$100 billion a year is nowhere sufficient to adapt to the damages brought on by climate disruptions, let alone pivot the energy systems of poor countries away from fossil fuels,\u201d The Times\u2019s Somini Sengupta reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ethical calculus of climate action is further complicated by the fact that some large developing countries have become major emitters. China is now the world\u2019s largest, having surpassed the United States in 2006, with the European Union in third place and India in fourth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China and India, in particular, have come under fire for not making bigger commitments ahead of Glasgow. In the near term, China has promised only that its annual emissions will peak sometime before 2030, which Kerry said \u201cdoesn\u2019t advance the ball sufficiently.\u201d India has not even set such a date, arguing that it is still much poorer than other major emitters and needs more time to develop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is because of these competing demands of fairness, political possibility and scientific necessity that climate diplomacy often finds itself at an impasse. \u201cLeaders in China and India argue that when the U.S. and other countries were emerging from poverty in the past, they didn\u2019t have to worry about what kind of energy sources they were using,\u201d The Times\u2019s David Leonhardt writes. But \u201cIf China cares as little about the planet as England did during the Industrial Revolution, everybody will suffer.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>[\u201cChina can make or break a global climate deal. What will it be willing to give?\u201d]</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If climate diplomacy fails, can climate action still succeed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, Kerry\u2019s message about the summit abruptly changed: \u201cGlasgow was never going to be, you know, the definitive one meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was going to galvanize the raising of ambition on a global basis.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry\u2019s reversal may be nothing more than an attempt by the Biden administration to save face. But he\u2019s not alone in downplaying the summit\u2019s significance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to categorically trash the [U.N. process] and throw the baby out with the bath water, but it\u2019s time to be realistic about what it can and can\u2019t do,\u201d Jessica Green, a professor of political science who focuses on climate governance, told James Temple at the MIT Technology Review.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What\u2019s the alternative? One, Temple writes, is something called \u201cexperimentalist governance,\u201d a model in which smaller institutions and governments that don\u2019t need global consensus can set binding standards that prompt broader changes in polluting industries. One example that proponents of \u201cexperimentalist governance\u201d point to is California\u2019s regulation of vehicle pollution, which arguably helped push automakers to develop electric vehicles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>[\u201cHow to Fix the Climate\u201d]</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe hope,\u201d Temple explains, \u201cis that a variety of governments or regulators trying a variety of approaches can provide critical lessons on what does and doesn\u2019t work, and drive a process that makes it cheaper and easier for other areas to enact emissions reduction policies and adopt cleaner technologies.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the technologies on which climate hopes get pinned are nascent, like carbon capture, and it\u2019s not clear when or if they will ever reach mass commercial viability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for rich nations to shift away from fossil fuels \u201cdoes not depend on huge scientific breakthroughs, welcome as they would be,\u201d Leonhardt points out. \u201cIt can happen largely with existing technologies, like wind, solar and nuclear power and the electrification of vehicles.\u201d And despite the free-rider problem, countries do have some self-interested reasons to reduce pollution from fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Depending on how you look at it, putting one\u2019s faith in a more piecemeal approach to stopping climate change might seem both hopelessly quixotic and more realistic than the exclusively top-down diplomatic model at work today. As Greta Thunberg recently said in an Opinion Video essay: \u201cAll political and economic systems have failed, but humanity has not yet failed.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do you have a point of view we missed?

Both countries were among those where fewer than 50% said they knew at least a \u201cmoderate amount\u201d about climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: He got booted for discussing climate change.
