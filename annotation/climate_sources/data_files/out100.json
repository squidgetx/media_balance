As a professional snowboarder, I\u2019ve ridden the steepest mountains in the world and spent weeks outside on foot-powered expeditions. Today I live in Truckee, a mountain town tucked into California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where I share my love of mountains with my wife and children. When we watch the Olympics, it still makes me joyous, but these days I also feel a little wistful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the world celebrates the achievements of athletes gliding over, down and across snow, I\u2019ve been reflecting on what I see in the mountains and for the future of these very Games. And for good reason. A team of researchers led by scientists at the University of Waterloo has found that if global emissions of greenhouse gases are not significantly reduced, only eight of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics will be cold enough to reliably do so again by the end of this century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Closer to home, the snowpack in the Sierra is at just 14 percent of the historical average. I never imagined I would see this in the middle of February.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The past three years were the hottest ever measured since record-keeping began in 1880, with 2016 ranking No. 1, followed by 2015 and 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists are warning us that the winter is becoming shorter . First freezes are starting later . So when I look at my children, I am even more convinced that we must take immediate and aggressive action on climate if we want their generation to learn these sports and enjoy winters in the mountains. More important, we must act quickly to preserve the culture and economies that depend on winter and snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report to be released this month by the group Protect Our Winters , which I founded, shows that tens of thousands of jobs are at stake in mountain towns as our climate warms. In total, the 191,000 jobs supported by snow sports in the 2015-16 winter season generated $6.9 billion in wages, while adding $11.3 billion in economic value to the national economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While a big snow season\u2019s economic boost is helpful, research shows that low snow years are disproportionately devastating, causing a combined annual revenue loss of $1 billion and 17,400 fewer jobs. These mountain towns are also the training grounds for American Olympians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All you have to do is watch the downhill race at Pyeongchang to know that snow-sports athletes don\u2019t just sit on their hands when faced with obstacles. That\u2019s why thousands of professional athletes, outdoor industry leaders, people who live in the mountains and those who live to ski and ride are joining forces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In person, through social media, in the streets and on Capitol Hill, we are letting our representatives know that believing in job creation and local economies means stepping up on legislation that supports renewable energy and places a price on carbon dioxide emissions. About 20 million people participate in winter sports every year. And many of them vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators in states with vital mountain economies love to talk about jobs. These people include Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Dean Heller of Nevada, both Republicans, along with representatives of congressional districts that include mountain towns, like Greg Walden of Oregon, Scott Tipton and Mike Coffman of Colorado, and my district\u2019s representative, Tom McClintock \u2014 Republicans as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the time comes to choose, these elected officials vote for legislation that will increase greenhouse gas emissions while ignoring the real threat to jobs in their own backyards \u2014 climate change. (Senator Gardner has a lifetime voting score from the League of Conservation Voters of 11 percent; Senator Heller\u2019s score is 13 percent. The top score among the representatives was 9 percent.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fossil fuel economy that they are voting to subsidize at substantial expense, both financial and environmental, won\u2019t last, and the sooner we move to renewable energy technologies, the better off we\u2019ll be. Our mountain economies still have a fighting chance, and we will fight for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/saving-winter-is-more-than-about-snow-its-about-jobs.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JEREMY JONES\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

As Arctic sea ice declines in response to warming temperatures, polar bears must fast for longer periods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prolonged fasting periods have been linked to reduced body condition, reproduction and survival in some polar bear populations, the study found. Continued sea ice loss ultimately threatens polar bear survival Arctic-wide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy \u2013 and inspiring action,\u201d said the University of Wyoming's Steven Amstrup, who conceived the project and is a co-author of the study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amstrup is also the chief scientist at Polar Bears International, a conservation organization dedicated to polar bears.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The authors modeled polar bear survival under a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario, which, if it occurs, would mean that all but a few polar bear populations would collapse by 2100, the study found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all,\u201d said Amstrup.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Recent Siberian heat wave 'almost impossible' without climate change, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read this: Arctic will see ice-free summers by 2050 as globe warms, study says</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Climate change may push polar bears to the brink of extinction within 100 years, study says\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

It cost more than $300,000 -- thanks, Google's Sergey Brin -- and didn't taste very good. But the texture was right, and it saved a cow. Maybe one day it can save the Earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the real play behind the test-tube burgers. The hope, according to Dutch scientist Mark Post, who led the team, is that they can eventually help stop global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for moving away from raising and slaughtering animals for food is typically portrayed in terms of animal welfare. But increasingly the argument is about planetary welfare: Meat is simply a huge, huge contributor to climate change, and it's only going to get bigger as the billions of people in emerging economies begin demanding the meat-heavy diets they associate with wealth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this 2009 column, I laid out some of the numbers behind this debate. They're worth thinking about today. The column is slightly edited from its original version.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a 2006 United Nations report, livestock accounts for 18 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. That's larger than the entire transportation sector. Burgers, in other words, are doing more damage to the planet than SUVs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of meat's contribution to climate change is intuitive. It's more energy efficient to grow grain and feed it to people than it is to grow grain and turn it into feed that we give to calves until they become adults that we then slaughter to feed to people. Some of the contribution is gross. \"Manure lagoons,\" for instance, is the oddly evocative name for the acres of animal excrement that sit in the sun steaming nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. And some of it would make Bart Simpson chuckle. Cow gas -- interestingly, it's mainly burps, not flatulence -- is a real player.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the result isn't funny at all: Two researchers at the University of Chicago estimated that switching to a vegan diet would have a bigger impact than trading in your gas guzzler for a Prius (PDF). A study out of Carnegie Mellon University found that the average American would do less for the planet by switching to a totally local diet than by going vegetarian one day a week. That prompted Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to recommend that people give up meat one day a week to take pressure off the atmosphere. The response was quick and vicious. \"How convenient for him,\" was the inexplicable reply from a columnist at the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. \"He's a vegetarian.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The visceral reaction against anyone questioning our God-given right to bathe in bacon has been enough to scare many in the environmental movement away from this issue. The National Resources Defense Council has a long page of suggestions for how you, too, can \"fight global warming.\" As you'd expect, \"Drive Less\" is in bold letters. There's also an endorsement for \"high-mileage cars such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\" They advise that you weatherize your home, upgrade to more efficient appliances and even buy carbon offsets. The word \"meat\" is nowhere to be found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not an oversight. Telling people to give up burgers doesn't poll well. Ben Adler, an urban policy writer, explored that in a December 2008 article for the American Prospect. He called environmental groups and asked them for their policy on meat consumption. \"The Sierra Club isn't opposed to eating meat,\" was the clipped reply from a Sierra Club spokesman. \"So that's sort of the long and short of it.\" And without pressure to address the costs of meat, politicians predictably are whiffing on the issue. The Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, for instance, does nothing to address the emissions from livestock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pity of it is that compared with cars or appliances or heating your house, eating pasta on a night when you'd otherwise have made fajitas is easy. It doesn't require a long commute on the bus or the disposable income to trade up to a Prius. It doesn't mean you have to scrounge for change to buy a carbon offset. In fact, it saves money. It's healthful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it can be done immediately. A Montanan who drives 40 miles to work might not have the option to take public transportation. But he or she can probably pull off a veggie stew. A cash-strapped family might not be able buy a new dishwasher. But it might be able to replace meatballs with mac-and-cheese. That is the whole point behind the cheery PB&J Campaign, which reminds that \"you can fight global warming by having a PB&J for lunch.\" Given that PB&J is delicious, it's not the world's most onerous commitment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also worth saying that this is not a call for asceticism. It's not a value judgment on anyone's choices. Going vegetarian might not be as effective as going vegan, but it's better than eating meat, and eating meat less is better than eating meat more. It would be a whole lot better for the planet if everyone eliminated one meat meal a week than if a small core of die-hards developed perfectly virtuous diets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, if scientists could come up with an affordable, tasty meat that grows in a lab and doesn't impose much cost on the planet -- well, that might be the easiest solution of all.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}

Their sturdy roots clung to the crumbling mountainside. Their gnarled limbs reached toward the desert sky. The rings of their trunks told the story of everything they'd witnessed \u2014 every attack they'd rebuffed, every crisis they'd endured. Weather patterns shifted; empires rose and fell; other species emerged, mated, migrated, died. But here, in one of the harshest environments on the planet, the bristlecone pines survived. It seemed they always would.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the day in 2018 when Constance Millar ascended the trail to Telescope Peak \u2014 the highest point in Death Valley National Park \u2014 and discovered hundreds of dead and dying bristlecones extending as far as she could see.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trees' needles glowed a flaming orange; their bark was a ghostly gray. Millar estimated that the damage encompassed 60 to 70 percent of the bristlecones on Telescope Peak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's like coming across a murder scene,\" said Millar, an emerita research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service who has studied bristlecone pines for the better part of 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a study published this spring, she and fellow researchers showed that the West's worst drought in at least 1,200 years had critically weakened the trees. Voracious bark beetles \u2014 a threat to which bristlecones were previously thought immune \u2014 delivered the death blow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After outlasting millennia of disruptions and disaster, human-caused climate change is proving too much for the ancient trees to bear. Rising temperatures have caused an explosion in the populations of insects that threaten the trees and undermined their capacity to defend themselves, scientists say. Although Great Basin bristlecone pines are not considered at risk of extinction, cherished specimens and distinctive populations are struggling to survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And bristlecones are not the only victims. At this very moment, a fast-moving fire is scorching through the iconic giant sequoia grove in Yosemite National Park. Cedars are choking on saltwater as rising seas engulf shorelines on the East Coast. A rare oak species clings to life as the Texas desert grows hotter and drier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that climate change has pushed almost a quarter of Earth's best-protected forests to a \"critical threshold\" for lost resilience \u2014 the point at which even a minor drought or heat wave could tip them into catastrophic decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Standing amid the devastation atop Telescope Peak, Millar realized, \"This could be a harbinger of what could be happening in the future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If nature's consummate survivors could not cope with catastrophic warming, she wondered, what did that mean for the rest of life on this planet?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And if humanity didn't heed the warnings of these fallen elders, what would it say about us?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Prehistoric jewels\u2019</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No organism on Earth is known to live as long as the Great Basin bristlecone pine. The oldest documented tree, a well-hidden specimen nicknamed \"Methuselah,\" after the long-lived biblical patriarch, was a sapling when the ancient Egyptians built their pyramids more than 4,500 years ago. Even the relatively youthful trees in Death Valley are older than gunpowder, paper money and the English language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Their presence and their stability and their fortitude stretches our own sense of time,\" Millar said. \"It just slows people down ... and reminds us of how things were before humans were here.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The secret to their survival is their ability to withstand what others cannot. They exist at higher elevations than almost any other tree, thriving in the rocky, meager soils near rugged mountain peaks. Their branching root systems and waxy needles help them make the most of scant water. They produce a thick resin that traps insect invaders and quickly patches wounds. Their genomes, which are nine times as long as a human's, contain a multitude of mutations that give them a better chance of adapting to changing conditions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Few trees can take a beating like a bristlecone. They deal with crisis by sectioning off parts of their structures, enabling the rest of the tree to keep living while the injured limb is allowed to die. Their wood is so dense it rarely rots; the trunks of dead trees will remain standing for millennia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The species needs all these strengths to exist in Death Valley \u2014 a forbidding environment even by bristlecone standards. The park is further south than any other bristlecone habitat, and hotter and drier than any other place in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scores of other creatures benefit from the trees' persistence, Millar said. Bristlecones provide shade to elk and bighorn sheep, and shelter chipmunks and jack rabbits from predators and fierce weather. They allow snow to cling longer to the mountains' upper slopes, ensuring a supply of meltwater during the brutal summer months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And their staying power makes them invaluable to scientists. Bristlecone tree rings have allowed researchers to reconstruct a record of Earth's climate going back thousands of years; the field of research is known as \"dendrochronology.\" The rings reveal when volcanic eruptions occurred, how long droughts lasted, even when the surface of the sun became blotted by magnetic storms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"By translating the story told by tree rings, we have pushed back the horizons of history,\" the pioneering dendrochronologist Andrew Ellicott Douglass wrote in National Geographic in 1929.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He compared tree ring records to the Rosetta stone and called the ancient trees of the desert Southwest \"prehistoric jewels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In preserving the planet's past, bristlecones also have given humans a key to understanding our future. They capture the interactions between greenhouse gases, rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns and altered ecosystems, and they allow scientists to project what will happen as Earth continues to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's well spelled out that the loss of these trees would remove this natural archive,\" Millar said. \"I hope the general public will realize what a loss that would be.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A death on our watch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After her grisly discovery atop Telescope Peak, Millar immediately contacted Barbara Bentz, a research entomologist for the Forest Service based at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Logan, Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just a few years earlier, Bentz had surveyed bristlecone populations across the West and found that few were succumbing to the bark beetle outbreaks that decimated so many other species. She felt confident that the trees would remain resilient even as rising temperatures caused beetle populations to explode.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, when Bentz peeled a piece of bark off one of the Death Valley bristlecones, she found scores of tiny tunnels created by beetle larvae as the insects chewed through the tree's living tissue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Oh, no,\" Bentz thought to herself. \"It really is beetles. Oh, no.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She and her colleagues uncovered further evidence of insect damage in Utah's Wah Wah Mountains, where young bristlecones were attacked by a small brown beetle called a pinyon ips.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the beetles were unable to complete their life cycles inside bristlecone pines, Bentz said. Instead, it seemed that they were reproducing in nearby trees from a species different from the bristlecone. Higher temperatures \u2014 Inyo County, home to Death Valley, is already more than 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than in the preindustrial era \u2014 allowed the beetles to reproduce faster and caused their populations to swell dramatically. When the surplus spilled over into bristlecones, their defenses were overwhelmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scientists think the trees had been so stressed by drought that they could not fend off attacks they once would have vanquished with ease. Climate analyses showed that 2020 soil moisture levels in Death Valley and the Wah Wah range dipped to their lowest levels in at least 40 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar said the discovery should raise alarms all over the West, where lakes are shrinking, snowpacks are declining and heat records are being set. The White Mountains \u2014 home to Methuselah and many more of the world's oldest bristlecones \u2014 lie just 100 miles from Death Valley and have a similar climate. They could easily become the next site of a beetle attack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't want Methuselah to die on our watch,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the species is not considered at risk of extinction, she added, the death of important subpopulations is still a reason to mourn. Each disappearance not only represents a loss for the landscape, but also is a sacrifice of the genetic diversity those populations contained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millar recalled another visit to Death Valley, when she hiked through an area called the Last Chance Range in search of a bristlecone pine cluster that was rumored still to exist there. By the time she found a single remaining tree, it was dead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the specimen had a gene that made it uniquely capable of surviving in that forbidding landscape, there was no chance of resurrecting it. No hope of collecting seeds for replanting, or taking a cutting in an attempt to produce clones. No opportunity to draw on the tree's DNA to help the rest of the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That, to me, is the dramatic element of watching a population go extinct,\" Millar said. All of that unique genetic material, the product of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution, is gone for good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arid forests around the globe have experienced a devastating loss of resilience in the past two decades, according to the analysis published Wednesday in Nature. Satellite imagery shows that these ecosystems are less able to bounce back after fluctuations in weather or periods of drought. Tropical and temperate forests \u2014 the steamy Amazon, the North Woods of Minnesota \u2014 are in similar decline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trend was seen in forests altered by human activities as well as those that remain almost untouched by direct human action \u2014 an indication that climate change, rather than local deforestation or pollution, is primarily at fault.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, 23 percent of untouched forests are approaching the point at which they could be pushed into an abrupt and irreversible transition, the scientists said. Rainforest could turn into grassland. Thick stands of pine might give way to shrubs and desert.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a strong warning, I think, for society,\" said Giovanni Forzieri, a professor of sustainable development and climate change at the University of Florence and lead author of the Nature study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He pointed out that most of the world's climate plans count on forests to pull planet-warming gases out of the atmosphere. If these ecosystems collapse, humanity will find it difficult, if not impossible, to stave off catastrophic warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Averting extinction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Murphy Westwood, the vice president for science and conservation at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois, each loss feels like a moral failing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's overwhelming and almost crushing,\" she said, \"the stark reality of the biodiversity crisis that's on our hands.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, Westwood helped publish a sweeping assessment of 58,497 tree species worldwide that found that nearly 30 percent are at risk of being wiped out. At least 142 species have gone extinct in the wild.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just trees. With global temperatures already more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than in the preindustrial era, the Earth is losing species at a rate hundreds to thousands of times faster than normal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the world remains on its current warming track, as much as 29 percent of all creatures on land will face very high risk of extinction. In the ocean, the destruction will be even greater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But humanity's growing understanding of all we might lose, Westwood said, also offers us a chance to change course. We can conserve rare organisms and protect fragile ecosystems. We can reverse deforestation and stop burning the fossil fuels that cause the planet to warm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If we can see it happening in front of our very eyes,\" she said, \"then we know we have the tools and knowledge to prevent another extinction.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She pointed to an expedition she helped direct this spring, which rediscovered a tree that scientists had believed to be extinct.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures and dwindling water over the past century had killed off every known specimen of Quercus tardifolia, an oak known for its fuzzy evergreen leaves. But Westwood and other scientists held out hope that the species still clung to existence somewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After weeks of trekking through the canyons of Big Bend National Park in Texas, they stumbled upon a single tardifolia tree \u2014 scorched by fire and ravaged by fungal disease but undeniably, miraculously, alive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The researchers plan to collect acorns and cuttings from the tree that can be used to regrow the species in botanic gardens and arboretums.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a second chance to prevent a species extinction,\" said Wes Knapp, the chief botanist for the conservation nonprofit NatureServe and another member of the expedition. \"That's really rare, to have a second chance in nature. It means we can move. We can act. That's what we have to do now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further west, Millar and Bentz plan to return to Death Valley this August to more thoroughly assess the state of the park's bristlecone pines and then develop strategies for preserving the trees that remain. They are developing chemical repellents based on the trees' natural defenses to protect \"high-value trees,\" such as Methuselah. And they are surveying all the nation's bristlecone stands, searching for the genetic variations that might help the species survive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid the challenges facing both trees and humanity, Millar said, the bristlecones offer lessons in how to hang on. Their tenacity is an antidote to despair. Their genetic diversity is a bulwark as they face the unknown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"From a human standpoint, I think that translates into innovation and resilience,\" Millar said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To live like a bristlecone is to never let go of hope.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

This, like all his policies, is, he says, climate policy, and serves racial \"equity\" (by improving urban air quality).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the White House calls a \"fact sheet\" says Biden's administration will \"support market demand\" for EVs by \"driving demand\" with \"point-of-sale incentives\" to encourage \"deployment\" of EVs. Translation: Subsidies, including tax credits for purchasers, will fiddle the market by lowering EV prices enough to manufacture a demand sufficient to justify manufacturing the vehicles in quantities that the administration says are vital for the planet. Biden even wants $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations. When U.S. automobile sales exploded from 8 million vehicles on U.S. roads in 1920 to 23 million in 1930 without tax credits, the private sector, responding to real rather than synthetic demand, built sufficient gas stations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchasers, until a manufacturer sells 200,000. GM and Tesla have reached this cap. GM wants the tax credit restored and made permanent. Internal Revenue Service data for 2014 showed that the biggest beneficiaries were households with adjusted gross income of at least $100,000. One percent went to households earning less than $50,000. States, too, have joined the market manipulation. In California, where about 47 percent of EVs are sold, buyers can gain up to $15,000. That such subsidies \"work\" is shown by what happens when they end: In 2015, when Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit, EV sales plummeted 89 percent in two months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden's policy to use less affluent Americans' money to entice more affluent Americans to buy EVs is only one of the contemplated regressive policies by which his administration would transfer wealth upward. Another such policy would cancel student debts for some of the fortunate minority of Americans who, having college degrees, will likely enjoy lifetime earnings significantly higher than those of the less fortunate majority. And if Democrats repeal the $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes by individuals filing their federal income taxes, this would almost entirely benefit very wealthy taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But desperate times require desperate measures, and Earth, the administration says, desperately needs EVs. For reasons unrelated to climate change \u2014 including cost and convenience \u2014 the future of EVs probably would be bright even without government midwifery. Perhaps, however, these should be called \"19.3 percent coal cars,\" that being the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal. Furthermore, Bjorn Lomborg, a climate writer, notes, EVs require large batteries that \"are often produced in China using coal power. According to the [International Energy Agency], just producing the battery for an electric car can emit almost a quarter as much of the greenhouse gases that a gasoline car will emit across its entire lifetime.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama-Biden administration \"Cash for Clunkers\" tried to meld economic stimulus and environmental stewardship. Consumers trading in old vehicles received vouchers for more climate-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 vouchers for $3,500 or $4,500, depending on the miles-per-gallon difference between trade-in and the new purchase. A Brookings Institution study found that the 55-day program's $2.85 billion essentially shifted \"roughly a few billion [consumers'] dollars forward from the subsequent two quarters following the program.\" Most of the 677,842 sales \u2014 that many clunkers were traded in and, as required by law, destroyed \u2014 were just \"slightly earlier [purchases] than otherwise would have occurred.\" They did create some jobs \u2014 at a cost of $1.4 million each.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, whose environmentally responsible recycling extends to recycling threadbare ideas, proposes $392 billion for 10 years of tax credits and vouchers for those who replace gas-powered vehicles with EVs. Biden wants to recycle the $7,500 EV tax credit. All such measures will have a climate impact too tiny to measure, given that U.S. personal cars, of which EVs will be a small proportion for many years, produce only 2.4 percent of global emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1928, presidential candidate Herbert Hoover's supporters said Republicans had put \"the proverbial 'chicken in every pot.' And a car in every backyard, to boot.\" Biden should promise coq au vin on every plate and two Teslas in every garage. Progress, or at least progressivism, is inexorable.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

Several companies are experimenting with new shipping methods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, a 24,000-liter hermetically sealed plastic container, or flexitank, carrying organically grown pinot grigio from Sicily arrived in a cargo container at Filling Station East, a wine packaging facility near the port in Bayonne, N.J.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The wine was for Gotham Project, a company that specializes in kegged wine, which it sells to bars and restaurants in almost 40 states. The Sicilian pinot grigio, the equivalent of about 32,000 750-milliliter bottles, was siphoned through a thick hose from the flexitank into a 6,400-gallon stainless steel tank. Eventually, it will fill kegs, cans and bottles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But those bottles will not be the ordinary single-use wine variety that should be recycled (but more likely get trashed). These Gotham Project bottles are intended to be reused multiple times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of returnable, reusable bottles is to cut down on waste, while reducing the carbon output of the wine industry, moves dictated by the necessity of combating climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers have known for at least a decade that the single largest portion of the carbon footprint of a bottle of wine comes from the energy used to manufacture that bottle, transport it to the winery to be filled and then distribute it around the globe for consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the need to reduce humanity\u2019s carbon production becomes more urgent, some in the wine industry have begun to examine alternatives to the long-accepted, energy-guzzling methods for bottling and shipping wine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that some of the best solutions may be old methods of shipping and packaging, long ago discarded, like bottles that can be returned, sanitized and reused 10 times or more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project is one of a few companies experimenting with selling wine in returnable bottles. Gotham\u2019s look like sturdy Burgundy bottles, green glass for reds and clear for whites and ros\u00e9s. But they are embossed with \u201cReturn & Reuse\u201d and sealed solely with corks, avoiding the waste that would come with foil capsules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham is trying out the bottles with a small group of retailers and restaurants in three state: New York, Massachusetts and Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reusable bottles are a natural next step for a company that for more than a decade has promoted the use of its stainless steel wine kegs as a better, less wasteful method of selling wines by the glass in restaurants and bars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFirst and foremost, we care about how the wine tastes: Freshness was top of mind,\u201d said Bruce Schneider, who, with a partner, Charles Bieler, founded Gotham in 2010. \u201cThe second factor was carbon footprint and reducing packaging waste.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Schneider estimates that by selling wine in reusable stainless steel kegs, which each hold the equivalent of 26 750-milliliter bottles, Gotham has eliminated more than 5 million single-use glass bottles from being tossed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOver 3 billion bottles a year go to landfill,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cOnly around 30 percent of glass bottles are recycled in the U.S. It\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And because the kegs use inert gas to fill the empty space as wine is poured out through a tap, the wine is kept fresher than it would be in bottles, which might sit around half empty for several days in a restaurant, slowly oxidizing, before they are emptied. From Mr. Schneider\u2019s perspective, reusable bottles are a natural evolution. It\u2019s after all not a new technology. Older generations may still remember the early morning arrival of the milkman, who would leave fresh bottles and take away the empties, which the dairy would reuse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thick soda and seltzer bottles were likewise returned and reused. Shoppers at farmers\u2019 markets today may still encounter similar reusable bottles from local dairies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reusable bottles have a long history in wine, particularly in European wine regions, where even today shoppers might carry their own demijohns to a nearby wine shop or cooperative, to be filled from a tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, frugality largely gave way to convenience in the last third of the 20th century. Disposability became a virtue to the detriment of the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham is not the only company to introduce reusable wine bottles. Good Goods, a New York start-up, began testing its reusable bottle with 14 retailers around the country last year. Zach Lawless, the chief executive of Good Goods, says wine producers who are environmentally conscious in their farming and production have a special incentive to adopt the bottles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey put so much effort into their work, but consumers don\u2019t experience it,\u201d Mr. Lawless said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to put their mission into how their product is experienced.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply switching to reusable bottles could diminish the amount of glass thrown away, but it cannot reduce the carbon footprint appreciably unless the shipping angle is addressed as well. That\u2019s where the flexitank comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As cargo gets heavier, it requires more fuel to ship. Aside from the energy required to manufacture wine bottles, the bottles themselves are relatively heavy. Environmentally conscious producers understand this and have tried to shave off weight, using lighter bottles. Nonetheless, plenty of producers continue to opt for wasteful trophy bottles, relying on a tried-and-true formula in which consumers equate heavier bottles with higher quality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A far better solution would be to ship wine in bulk, using flexitanks, essentially giant plastic bladders within metal frames, rather than bottles, and then to bottle the wine close to where it will be sold. This cuts way down on the weight of shipping. Mr. Schneider estimated that the wine in the 24,000-liter flexitank, which fit into one shipping container, would have required three containers if the wine had been bottled before shipping.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shipping in bulk is nothing novel. Every year wine is sold in bulk, often by producers making inexpensive wine that will be sold elsewhere in the world under any number of proprietary labels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes producers whose supply of wine is diminished because of vintage conditions will check the bulk market to see what supplemental wine might be available. During the last series of drought years, sharp-eyed consumers may have spotted inexpensive California wine brands with labels citing sources like Argentina or Languedoc in the fine print.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conversely, some Napa and Sonoma producers who were concerned that the California wildfires last year might have tainted certain vineyards sold off the wines made from those grapes on the bulk market rather than bottle it under their own label.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project does not buy wine on the bulk market. Rather, under long-term agreements it buys directly from producers who farm organically or sustainably in Europe, South America, California and New York.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I tasted Beaujolais, California sauvignon blanc, ros\u00e9 from the south of France, Tuscan sangiovese and Finger Lakes cabernet franc, all packaged in Gotham\u2019s returnable bottles. Each was fresh, clean and unpretentious, all delightful, inexpensive wines that were a pleasure to drink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as returnable bottles are nothing new, neither is shipping fine wines in bulk. Right up through the 1960s, renowned Bordeaux producers used to ship their wines in barrels to Britain, where they would be bottled for sale by merchants. If you are ever lucky enough to stumble upon, say, an old 1950s Ch\u00e2teau Latour from the cellar of some old London club, chances are the label will cite the merchant as well as the producer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The British, by the way, are today far ahead of Americans in point-of-sale bottling. Jancis Robinson, the British wine writer, estimates that as much as 45 percent of all still wine imported into Britain arrives in bulk and is bottled there, generally by supermarkets that sell a great deal of inexpensive wine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not all wines can be bottled at the point of origin. Many appellations, like certain Riojas or Brunello di Montalcino, require that wines be aged for a certain period of time in bottles before they can be sold. But plenty of wines face no such impediments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Creating a reusable bottle system is not nearly so simple as asking people to return the bottles they buy. Of necessity, returnable bottles must be thicker and heavier than those intended for single use, horrifyingly so if they were to be shipped any long distance rather than being bottled and sold locally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They need to be sturdy enough to withstand repeated cleanings, along with being shipped back and forth from filling facility to distributor to retailer to merchant. (That\u2019s the three-tier system in action, as required by law. It uses a lot of extra fuel.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reusable bottles must also have labels that are easy to remove when cleaning, hearkening back to the days before mobile phones, when rather than photograph the label of a memorable wine, you steamed the label off and pasted it in a scrapbook. For its reusable bottles, Gotham had to employ an older form of water-soluble glue rather than the more common pressure-sensitive adhesives, which are far more difficult to remove.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While reusable bottles are laudable and idealistic, they are worthless if consumers don\u2019t hold up their end by returning them. When Good Goods first tested its reusable bottle last summer, Mr. Lawless said, only 25 percent of them were actually returned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In analyzing the problem, Mr. Lawless said they learned asking for a small deposit, to be returned when the bottles were brought back, was not a sufficient incentive for consumers to overcome their preference for disposability.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when Good Goods switched from a deposit system to offering store credit for returning the bottles, Mr. Lawless said, compliance rose to 85 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFraming it as a reward rather than a deposit made a massive impact,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gotham Project, on the other hand, has not asked for a deposit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Gotham is testing an app that will give consumers a choice of receiving a small cash reward for returning bottles or donating that amount to an environmental charity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe are hoping people will do it because it is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Scheider said. \u201cBut we also believe an incentive will help.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These reusable bottles are just tiny steps toward confronting a huge problem of waste and energy consumption. They are not the only possible solutions, either. One company in Britain is testing lightweight, flat bottles made of recycled plastic. Bacardi and other companies are testing biodegradable bottles made of plant materials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What\u2019s clear is the current system of shipping heavy, throwaway bottles around the globe is unsustainable, as simple and familiar as it might be. Change may seem difficult and inconvenient, but it\u2019s necessary and in the long run easier to accept than an overheated planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Podesta on Monday touted the administration record on energy production as well as climate change, arguing Democrats can run this fall on the fact they have bolstered the nation's oil and gas industry while tackling global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Podesta ran through a series of slides at the daily press briefing that showed the United States is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world, as well as the largest producer of gas and oil combined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In 2012 and 2013, it accounted for .22 and .24 percent of growth, which is the highest on record,\" he noted, adding, \"We've added 133,000 jobs in the last three years in the oil and natural gas extraction sector, and those numbers are projected to continue to grow.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Podesta -- who is overseeing the president's climate action plan -- noted that solar and wind production had increased during President Obama's tenure. Over this period, electricity generation from solar increased by more than 10 times, and tripled from wind power, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama will be showcasing the issue of climate change this week, by unveiling a report Tuesday detailing how global warming will affect the nation in the years to come and announcing new solar power commitments by the private sector at the end of the week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We obviously need all hands on deck if we're going to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, the impacts that the IPCC warned us about just a month or so ago and that the National Climate Assessment will bring into sharp focus with respect to the U.S.,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the briefing, Podesta said he was confident that Democrats could successfully counter criticism that they're opposed to domestic oil and gas production.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People will make that argument, but I think that if you look at the overall mix, it's cleaner, it's more domestically produced,\" he said. \"We have turned the corner so that we're now producing more oil than we're importing. Those are all facts that I think that -- that can be utilized by candidates to make the case that we're on the right path to have a cleaner, better and more secure, more American-made energy future for the country.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Podesta said he was confident the White House could beat back any attempts by congressional Republicans to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's upcoming proposal to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. which will come out in early June.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"All I would say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We're committed to moving forward with those rules,\" he said. \"We're committed to maintaining the authority and the president's authority to ensure that the Clean Air Act is fully implemented. That's critical to the health of the American people, the health of the economy and the health of our environment. So they may try, but I think that there's -- there are no takers at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

It will allow Biden to beef up environmental standards at home without the risk of American businesses losing out to companies that operate in countries with laxer environmental standards, they say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Biden administration wants to have a trading system where people are not advantaged by declining to follow through on commitments they've made to any number of issues, but notably on climate change in the 2015 Paris agreement,\" said Daniel Esty, a professor at Yale Law School with expertise in environment and trade policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift under Biden could spell a major change in the country's trade approach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue could come to a head sooner than later: More than 100 lawmakers sent a letter yesterday urging Biden to add Paris commitments to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Such an action would help restore the United States' role as a leader in addressing the climate crisis and demonstrate how trade agreements can be utilized to advance climate goals,\" the members write.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who leads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, points out that a simple majority in Congress can approve new multilateral environmental agreements under the deal. Blumenauer hopes the Biden administration takes advantage ofthat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After all, although the United States routinely signs trade agreements that include environmental provisions, critics say that those commitments lack teeth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the U.S. trade record is even more sparse when it comes to climate change issues specifically. Republicans in 2016 successfully pushed for a measure to limit the fast-tracking of any deals that require domestic carbon cuts. When the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal was signed two years later under President Trump, its language made no explicit mention of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And environmentalists were part of a coalition of interest groups that helped sink the Obama administration's proposed trade agreement with other Pacific Rim countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, over concerns it made it too easy for corporations to pollute abroad.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Biden campaigned on working with U.S. allies to use trade to combat climate change \"without offering too many specifics,\" said Alexandra Stark, a senior researcher at the New America think tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s choice for chief trade negotiator will have her work cut out for her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Katherine Tai, who Biden chose to be U.S. trade representative, has a history of pushing behind the scenes for strong environmental standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tai, who serves as the chief trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee, played a central role in negotiations around revising the North American Free Trade Agreement during the Trump administration.The resulting deal was criticized on the left for leaving out any mention of climate,but activists and politicians say that was despite her efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've seen her push ardently for environmental priorities to be taken seriously and, in fact, implemented in trade agreements,\" said Ben Beachy, director of the living economy program at the Sierra Club, an environmental group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe probably will force Biden to take a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The European Union is working to put in place a carbon border tax. Under this system, countries that have not already set a carbon price of their own may find that those prices are added in when they export their goods to Europe. It's a change that could have major repercussions for American industries, and it could spur discussions in the United States about how to avoid the fees \u2014 either by putting in place a domestic carbon price or coming up with an alternative treaty arrangement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The U.S. will have to respond,\" said Maria Panezi, a professor of international trade law at the University of New Brunswick in Canada. \"Given how quickly the European Union moves on this issue, their hand will be forced.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has moved away from pushing for a carbon price, instead focusing on economic stimulus and investments in green energy. At the same time, hisenergy plancalls for imposing \"adjustment fees or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Panezi suggests that this might be a difficult needle to thread: The World Trade Organization allows countries to impose adjustment fees on imports only if they already have their own domestic restrictions. \"You have to clean up your own backyard first,\" Panezi puts it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One option for the Biden administration would be to embrace legislation sponsored by Blumenauer that would impose a carbon tax in the United States and carbon tariffs for imported goods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's going be an argument that something like 50 other countries now have pricing mechanisms as part of their climate change strategies [and] American exporters will be at risk of facing carbon charges,\" said Esty, whowas floatedas a possible contender to lead the Environmental Protection Agency last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Biden administration is confronting a trade landscape radically altered by Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's trade wars have angered allies and supercharged tensions with China, and it may be hard to roll back the clock: Reducing tariffs couldspark pushbackfrom segments of U.S. industry or engender criticism that Biden is soft on China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the Trump administration so aggressively promoted the export of fossil fuels that the United Statesbriefly overtookSaudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign,Biden was unclear about whether he supportsbanning the export of fossil fuels.The United States blocked the sales of crude oil abroad for four decades until Congress and President Barack Obama lifted the moratorium in 2015.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tai also will have to balance human rights considerations:A recent reportfound that solar companies that supply more than a third of the world's polysilicon, a key ingredient in solar panels, are tied to forced labor in China's autonomous Xinjiang region.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental advocates want to make sure new trade agreements don't accelerate the race to the bottom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past, they've seen trade agreements as a problem rather than a solution because manycompanies have used free trade pacts to move operations to the countries with laxer pollution rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"These corporations then make steel, auto parts and other products with a high degree of climate pollution and send them back to the U.S. for our consumption,\" said Beachy of the Sierra Club. \"As a result, the amount of carbon that goes into the goods we import is so large that it equals the total carbon emissions of all U.S. factories combined.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As eager as allies may be for renegotiated deals with the new administration, they may have to wait.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has said that he intends to hold off on any new agreements until he has tackled top domestic priorities on the economy and coronavirus response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Biden is wasting no time fulfilling his campaign promise of nixing the Keystone XL pipeline, which is expected to be one of his first actions in office. Blocking the proposed oil conduit, meant to bring crude from Alberta to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, may end up being a point of contention between Biden and the leader to the north, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who supports the pipeline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Power playsBiden\u2019s Day 1 executive orders are set to overturn Trump\u2019s climate legacy on dozens of fronts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president-elect \"intends to sign more than a dozen executive orders and direct nearly 100 agency actions aimed at unraveling Donald Trump's environmental policies\" within hours of taking office Wednesday, our colleagues Steven Mufson, Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to a long-expected return to the Paris climate accord, Biden will sign \"a broad executive order\" to federal agencies to reassess scores of Trump-era environmental policies.

These are very real risks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yellen's commitments mark a victory for lawmakers and advocates who want the Biden administration to enlist Treasury's sweeping influence to address the dangers that climate change poses to the economy,\" Politico writes.

In some parts of the world, that is exactly what happened last year, climate scientists reported Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising temperatures add energy to the atmosphere, and computer models warn that this will produce wider and wilder swings in temperature and rainfall and alter prevailing wind patterns. In examining a dozen extreme weather events last year, scientists found that evidence that human activity \u2014 in particular, emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 was a partial culprit in about half of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet other extreme weather events, including the drought that withered the Midwest, appear to be just part of a natural pattern, the scientists concluded. The research, a series of 19 studies by 18 teams, was published in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While global warming will likely increase the number and severity of extreme weather events, climate scientists have been reluctant to attribute a particular heat wave, storm or drought directly to global warming, because of the natural variations of weather. But with advances in computer modeling and analysis of climate data, they are now able to tease out the contributions of human civilization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The extreme weather events \u201cwould have likely occurred regardless of climate change,\u201d said Thomas R. Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe importance of attribution research comes with understanding, however, the impact that climate change adds, or doesn\u2019t add, to any extreme event,\u201d he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The articles\u2019 editors likened climate change to someone habitually driving a bit over the speed limit. Even if the speeding itself is unlikely to directly cause an accident, it increases the likelihood that something else \u2014 a wet road or a distracting text message \u2014 will do so and that the accident, when it occurs, will be more calamitous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even when global warming contributes to extreme weather, \u201cnatural variability can still be the primary factor in any individual extreme event,\u201d the editors wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To examine causes of the Midwest drought last year, the most severe since the 1950s, researchers ran computer models comparing two situations: one with present-day concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the other with the much lower greenhouse gas concentrations before the Industrial Revolution. They found little difference in the frequency of Midwest droughts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But scientists performing a similar comparison for the heat wave that blanketed much of the United States in July last year estimated that such heat waves now occur four times as frequently because of the influence of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was really clear and it was really stark,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Peterson, principal scientist at the climate center. \u201cThings had changed dramatically.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another team, reviewing data on a heat wave in the eastern United States in the spring of last year, estimated that the activities of humans contributed about one-third of the 6.6-degree spike in temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis of Hurricane Sandy did not look at the dynamics of the storm, but rather how often floodwaters have reached the heights seen last October. Because sea levels have been rising, the chances of Sandy-like flooding inundating the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan have risen from once every 2,330 years in 1950 to once every 1,570 years today, the researchers said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If sea level rise over the next 40 years is low, about half a foot, then the chances of flooding increase slightly. If sea level rise is at the top end up of predictions \u2014 two yards \u2014 then much smaller storms would cause as much flooding as Sandy did and Lower Manhattan could be inundated every couple of years by 2100, the researchers said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cCoastal communities are facing a looming crisis due to climate-related sea level rise,\u201d said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and one of the authors of the Sandy study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Record-low ice cover in the Arctic in 2012 was partially caused by global warming, researchers also said. But heavy rains in northern Europe, China and Japan were all explainable by natural variability.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The island was declared effectively uninhabitable, water service was severed, and power is not expected back until month's end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate Point: Subscribe to USA TODAY's weekly newsletter on climate, energy and the environment</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With insurance and FEMA assistance, Melancon, 63, is already making plans to repair his oyster-sorting shed, to clean his yard of debris, and to replace the lawnmower swamped by Hurricane Ida's storm surge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while Melancon suffered relatively little damage this time, things could have been much worse, not just for him but for all of the approximately 1,500 people who call this island home, and for the tens of thousands more who vacation here each summer. Experts say Grand Isle is a harbinger for things to come: rising sea levels, stronger storms and more destruction for coastal areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With sea levels rising an average of 3.6 millimeters annually due to climate change, Louisiana's coast is simultaneously sinking, possibly in connection with the vast amounts of oil, natural gas and water that have been extracted over the past decades to fuel and power the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means places like Grand Isle, reached by a long causeway from mainland Louisiana, is demonstrating today what other coastal areas will see in the coming years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it raises questions about how long governments will try to protect property and how much tax money they're willing to spend rebuild roads and power lines and homes before ceding it to the sea. In 2014, federal scientists said Grand Isle sank 1.3 inches in five years, one of the largest drops globally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Louisiana coast is in general a canary in the coal mine,\" said Samuel Bentley, a Louisiana State University expert on coastal erosion. \"We are experiencing conditions now that other areas will face in the future. From the perspective of a homeowners or a city official, it doesn't matter if it's subsidence or sea level rise. It becomes a political decision at some point.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The history of 'hauntingly beautiful' Grand Isle, Louisiana</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Federal, state and local officials have long known the danger faced by Grand Isle, which under normal circumstances is a bucolic, sandy island with shave ice shops, fishing rodeos and beach bar after beach bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, the New York Times declared the island one of its top places to visit for 2020, ranking it with Greenland, Tokyo and the British Virgin Islands. But the reporter also asked, \"Does a place appear more hauntingly beautiful when you know it\u2019s disappearing?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First used by indigenous, nomadic natives, the Grand Isle and nearby Cheni\u00e8re Caminada and Leeville areas grew in the early 1800s as the French, Spanish and growing United States colonized Louisiana. Pirate and privateer Jean Lafitte frequented the area, and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War occupied an unfinished fort on adjacent Grand Terre Island, fleeing after the United States retook New Orleans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the enslavement of people was banned following the Civil War, plantations on Grand Isle were replaced by vacation resorts for the wealthy. They were themselves destroyed and then rebuilt following the 1893 Cheni\u00e8re Caminada hurricane, which sent a wall of water 16 feet high across the area, killing about half of the residents of the nearby farming community and erasing the fields that once grew produce for New Orleans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been trying to repair and protect the island since 1976, and in some areas installed a giant sand-filled tube known as \"the burrito\" running parallel to the ocean's waves at the highest point on the beach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'It ain't easy right now': Hurricane Ida strands residents, wipes away landmarks on Louisiana island</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those efforts have been repeatedly set back by hurricanes: 2005's Katrina damaged the repairs, which were almost fixed by the time Gustav arrived in 2008, destroying some of the repairs to the repairs. Subsequent hurricanes damaged subsequent repairs, and last summer, state taxpayers spent $7.5 million repairing levee breaches and building a new 1\u00bc-mile-long beach, which immediately became a popular gathering spot, drawing more people to the island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was a great summer, the island was booming. You could feel everyone doing good,\" said seventh-generation Grand Isle resident Holden Landry, 25.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Landry's family has owned one of the island's grocery stores, Sureway Supermarket since his grandfather founded it in 1976. His grandfather, Landry said, never saw storms like Ida.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My mom had two of these storms. And my sister and I had our first one at 25 and 27,\" Landry said. \"We all have a business plan down here, but God kinda scribbled over our plans.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ida knocked out power to the Landry's store, spoiling all the refrigerated and frozen food. As the island struggled without electricity 10 days later, Landry sat outside the store in a golf cart, escorting in what few customers came so they could buy essentials, from coffee to gas cans needed to keep generators running.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Landry, who left the island to attend college on the mainland, returned after graduation to help run the store, and now has a two-month-old son, the eighth generation to be raised here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cEach storm that hits, people go away. There\u2019s elderly locals who just don\u2019t come back,\" he said. \u201cThe easiest thing you could do is move away. But I want to stick it out. There\u2019s a lot of pride in being down here. If you have to start over, might as well start over in a place you have pride.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate could make hurricanes like 'freakish' Ida more common</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few doors down, Chris Collins took stock of his family's gas station and convenience store, Jo-Bob\u2019s. Like Sureway, the store wasn't officially open, but Collins and his mom were around to sell gas for generators, taking cash from people who had it, and giving IOUs to the others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019m grateful and humbled in ways I\u2019ve never been before,\" said Collins, who rode out the storm. \"That was a freakish storm. The worst case scenario? We just saw it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts predict storms like Ida will become more common as ocean waters warm, providing more heat energy to spin up hurricanes. Ida wasn't actually a worst-case scenario, they point out, because it intensified so rapidly that it never had time to generate a truly large surge like the 16-foot-high one from the 1893 Cheni\u00e8re Caminada hurricane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the howling winds ripped apart buildings, snapped power poles and drove stormwater nearly across the island. The three-foot-surge that hit the causeway serving Grand Isle peeled up portions of the road like flaking paint, narrowing the road to one lane in many areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Collins, 44, lived in New York City for many years, returning recently to help his parents run the store. He said he was shocked on his return to see how many more camps had been built in areas longtime locals would never have chosen, and the erosion of protective marshland caused by ships serving the offshore oil platforms blinking in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said he believes the loss of the island is ultimately inevitable \u2013 but struggles with how to adapt. Do they try selling to someone else? Wait for a government buyout? Just keep rebuilding their canopy and roof?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cRunning is not an option for me now,\" he said after a pause. \"The island still has its magic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back at his home, Melancon is picking through the debris, watching for roofing nails scattered in the grass, and wondering when the electricity and water will come back on. The seas have finally calmed, and he's anxious to get out to his oyster beds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His grandfather used to harvest oysters around Independence Island, but that has vanished beneath the waves, and Melancon now farms his oysters in several bays around Grand Isle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cGod took care of me,\" he said. \u201cI just want to get back to work.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The uncertain future of Grand Isle: 'Barrier islands are not forever'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conversations people on Grand Isle need to have are the same kinds of conversations coastal residents around the world need to be having, said Mark Davis, 67, the professor who directs the Tulane Center for Environmental Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Communities have to have a real conversation about the choices. Because otherwise at some point, decisions will be made for it,\" Davis said. \"The kind of issues that Grand Isle presents will replay in Miami Beach, in Norfolk, Virginia. We are going to face these questions and our options for each are different. But not one of them is ensured a future.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WATCH: Louisiana slowly reopening after Hurricane Ida</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recovering from disaster: Hurricane Ida will be 'devastating' to tourism industry</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis said the physics of what's happening to Grand Isle are not up for debate, regardless of climate change \u2013 sandy barrier islands wash away while bearing the brunt of whatever storms hit them. Climate change, he said, is accelerating a geological process that's been well underway for centuries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Barrier islands are not forever. And sea levels are not forever. And right now they are shifting and changes at rates we have no experience with,\" he said. \"Grand Isle is in transition. The question is, transition to what?

Cycles of drought and deluge have always tested the limits of our water infrastructure's ability to keep agricultural and metropolitan areas habitable and productive (even as the sources of that water face ecological devastation), but climate change threatens more fires, more dry spells and higher temperatures.

Muller|Professor of Physics|University of California, Berkeley|Five scientific papers published on BerkeleyEarth.org|Academic|Muller discusses his change in perspective on global warming and the scientific methods used in his research.</p><p>N/A|N/A|Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project|N/A|Academic/Nonprofit|The project provides evidence and methodology related to earth's land temperature increase and its attribution to human activity.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Berkeley, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CALL me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I\u2019m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of the earth\u2019s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These findings are stronger than those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on global warming. In its 2007 report, the I.P.C.C. concluded only that most of the warming of the prior 50 years could be attributed to humans. It was possible, according to the I.P.C.C. consensus statement, that the warming before 1956 could be because of changes in solar activity, and that even a substantial part of the more recent warming could be natural.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our Berkeley Earth approach used sophisticated statistical methods developed largely by our lead scientist, Robert Rohde, which allowed us to determine earth land temperature much further back in time. We carefully studied issues raised by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations and poor ones) and from human intervention and data adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off). In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The historic temperature pattern we observed has abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect sunlight, make for beautiful sunsets and cool the earth\u2019s surface for a few years. There are small, rapid variations attributable to El Ni\u00f1o and other ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream; because of such oscillations, the \u201cflattening\u201d of the recent temperature rise that some people claim is not, in our view, statistically significant. What has caused the gradual but systematic rise of two and a half degrees? We tried fitting the shape to simple math functions (exponentials, polynomials), to solar activity and even to rising functions like world population. By far the best match was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as important, our record is long enough that we could search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent. Although the I.P.C.C. allowed for the possibility that variations in sunlight could have ended the \u201cLittle Ice Age,\u201d a period of cooling from the 14th century to about 1850, our data argues strongly that the temperature rise of the past 250 years cannot be attributed to solar changes. This conclusion is, in retrospect, not too surprising; we\u2019ve learned from satellite measurements that solar activity changes the brightness of the sun very little.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we\u2019ve tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect \u2014 extra warming from trapped heat radiation. These facts don\u2019t prove causality and they shouldn\u2019t end skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at least as well as carbon dioxide does. Adding methane, a second greenhouse gas, to our analysis doesn\u2019t change the results. Moreover, our analysis does not depend on large, complex global climate models, the huge computer programs that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s a scientist\u2019s duty to be properly skeptical. I still find that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I\u2019ve analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Katrina cannot be attributed to global warming. The number of hurricanes hitting the United States has been going down, not up; likewise for intense tornadoes. Polar bears aren\u2019t dying from receding ice, and the Himalayan glaciers aren\u2019t going to melt by 2035. And it\u2019s possible that we are currently no warmer than we were a thousand years ago, during the \u201cMedieval Warm Period\u201d or \u201cMedieval Optimum,\u201d an interval of warm conditions known from historical records and indirect evidence like tree rings. And the recent warm spell in the United States happens to be more than offset by cooling elsewhere in the world, so its link to \u201cglobal\u201d warming is weaker than tenuous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The careful analysis by our team is laid out in five scientific papers now online at BerkeleyEarth.org. That site also shows our chart of temperature from 1753 to the present, with its clear fingerprint of volcanoes and carbon dioxide, but containing no component that matches solar activity. Four of our papers have undergone extensive scrutiny by the scientific community, and the newest, a paper with the analysis of the human component, is now posted, along with the data and computer programs used. Such transparency is the heart of the scientific method; if you find our conclusions implausible, tell us of any errors of data or analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if the oceans are included. But if China continues its rapid economic growth (it has averaged 10 percent per year over the last 20 years) and its vast use of coal (it typically adds one new gigawatt per month), then that same warming could take place in less than 20 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in principle, is universally accepted.

If anything, the Earth is getting hotter faster than expected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Droughts, wildfires, floods</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, the world's tentative embrace of wind and solar renewable energy has bent the arc of a sizzling planet from apocalyptic by century's end (a 4 degrees Celsius increase over pre-industrial levels, or 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to merely catastrophic (3 degrees Celsius by 2100).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And promises on paper by nations to further cut emissions, if actually kept, could reduce temperature increases to maybe 2 to 2.4 Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even that would be terrifying. Disasters the planet already is experiencing in the form of droughts, wildfires, floods and intense storms would become more common and even more intense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One in 3 people would suffer severe heat rather than, as today, 1 in 7. Fresh water would grow more scarce, crop yields more meager and ocean ecosystems more distraught with the loss of coral reefs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the Paris accords urged every effort be taken to hold rising temperature from the pre-industrial era to 1.5 Celsius. It already has risen 1.1 degrees. Any hope of holding it to a 1.5-degree increase or even an unhealthy 2 degrees requires cutting fossil fuel emissions worldwide to net zero by 2050, and that means dramatic action this decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is an extraordinarily heavy lift given the fossil fuel dependency of such countries as China (30% of the world's emissions), the United States (15%), Europe (9%), India (7%) and Russia (5%) \u2013 and the barely addressed needs of less developed countries that must decarbonize and adapt to a warming climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists have made the math very easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a Reuters analysis of the findings, Earth can absorb only an additional 500 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions without warming beyond 1.5 Celsius. The nations of the world, led by China and America, now emit 50 billion tons per year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Glasgow summit was important</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It feels insurmountable, and that's why the climate summit in Glasgow, hosted by the United Nations and the United Kingdom, was closely watched.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Joe Biden, to his credit, has reversed the reckless apathy of the Trump administration and pledged to cut U.S. emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, with dramatic plans to transform reliance on fossil fuels in generating power and fueling vehicles. He'll preach this in Scotland, but with the sad reality that Congress is struggling to approve his plans to reach those goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Promises by the other key polluters is a mixed bag as the conference begins:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe is pledging a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China, whose President Xi Jinping did not attend the climate summit, is talking about only beginning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>India shunned a net-zero promise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Russia is aiming to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and rely on its vast forests to do the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world's citizens have already have seen and felt too much of climate change to tolerate further platitudes or empty promises.

It says the agency will issue a formal notice of its intention to develop a new rule \u201csimilarly intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric utility generating units and to solicit information for the agency to consider in developing such a rule.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The document does not explain how the E.P.A. will justify to the courts the decision to eliminate the regulation. Several industry attorneys familiar with the agency\u2019s plans said they expected Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, to argue that the Obama administration relied on an overly broad reading of federal clean air laws in writing the Clean Power Plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump has vowed since the campaign to \u201cget rid\u201d of the Obama-era environmental regulations. He has called the Clean Power Plan \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cjob killing,\u201d and in an executive order issued in March he directed Mr. Pruitt to dismantle the rules. Last month, Mr. Trump appeared to claim he had already done so, telling a crowd in Alabama: \u201cDid you see what I did to that? Boom, gone.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Killing the regulation has also been a high priority for Mr. Pruitt, who as attorney general of Oklahoma sued to overturn it in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in recent weeks, industry groups have pressed the Trump administration to fashion a new, narrower measure in its stead. Many have argued that creating such a replacement, rather than simply repealing the Clean Power Plan, is necessary to avoid lawsuits. Under a landmark agency determination known as the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. is required to regulate carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Pruitt has been under pressure from interest groups that deny the scientific consensus on climate change \u2014 that it is occurring and caused by human emissions \u2014 to overturn that determination. The E.P.A. document does not indicate Mr. Pruitt\u2019s plans, but creating a new regulation implicitly accepts that the federal government has a role in addressing the reduction of carbon dioxide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It remains unclear when the agency will formally repeal the rule. Liz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the document or plans for the rule.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clean Power Plan, which required states to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent by 2030 relative to 2005 has been tied up in litigation. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had set an Oct. 7 deadline for the E.P.A. to show progress in its decision making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brian Deese, who served as a senior adviser on climate change to Mr. Obama, said the E.P.A. was buying time. Asking the public for ideas, he said, is what an agency does when it is uncertain about how to proceed. Consideration of a new regulation could take months or even years, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to walk this tightrope,\u201d Mr. Deese said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow @NYTClimate on Twitter</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/climate/trump-climate-change.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: LISA FRIEDMAN\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Last week, President Biden signed an executive order promising that by 2030, half of all new vehicles sold in the United States will be electric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a transformative change for a nation in no small way defined by its love of the internal combustion engine. But on the heels of the latest dire United Nations climate change report \u2014 which the U.N. Secretary General said \u201cmust sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet\u201d \u2014 does Biden\u2019s plan go far enough? And can the climate problem posed by America\u2019s car dependency really be solved by swapping gasoline for batteries? Here\u2019s what people are saying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Goodbye to gasoline</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gas-powered vehicles are the biggest single source of greenhouse gases in the United States, accounting for more than a quarter of the country\u2019s total emissions. \u201cA rapid shift from fossil-fueled combustion engines to electric vehicles is an essential step toward mitigating climate change,\u201d The Times\u2019s Coral Davenport says. \u201cYou can\u2019t solve climate change without getting rid of them.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In line with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, President Biden has promised to put the country on a path to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Because vehicles stay on the road for many years, though, it\u2019s estimated that all new cars would have to be electric by 2035 to reach that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s feasible, technologically, to replace most cars already on the road with equally affordable and powerful electric models within the next decade,\u201d Davenport says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where things stand: In the United States, E.V.s remain something of a rarity: Just 2 percent of new cars sold are electric or plug-in hybrid, a far lower rate than in China and Europe, in large part because those places have more generous financial incentives and stricter auto regulations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But underneath the surface, the market is unmistakably moving in the electric direction. This year, General Motors announced that it would phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Jaguar and Daimler, the world\u2019s largest maker of heavy trucks, soon followed. And in May, Ford introduced an electric version of its F-150 pickup truck, the best-selling vehicle in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transition could happen more quickly than some think. Justin Rowlatt, the BBC\u2019s chief environmental correspondent, believes the E.V. market right now is about where the internet was around the late 1990s or early 2000s. \u201cThe internet, like all successful new technologies, did not follow a linear path to world domination,\u201d he wrote in June. \u201cIts growth was explosive and disruptive, crushing existing businesses and changing the way we do almost everything.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are E.V.s really a silver bullet for America\u2019s car problem?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you were trying to create a sustainable society from scratch, blanketing the country with highways and hundreds of millions of individually powered vehicles that sit idle 95 percent of the time is not how you\u2019d do it. Cars \u2014 whatever their fuel source \u2014 are one of the least energy-efficient modes we have of getting from point A to point B. Some argue that climate change should spur the country to rethink the car\u2019s centrality in American life, rather than just to replace one version of it with another.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe planet will be much better off if we switch to electric cars,\u201d the Times columnist Farhad Manjoo writes. \u201cBut gauzy visions of the guilt-free highways of tomorrow could easily distract us from the larger and more entrenched problem with America\u2019s transportation system. That problem isn\u2019t just gas-fueled cars but car-fueled lives \u2014 a view of the world in which huge private automobiles are the default method of getting around.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Transitioning to E.V.s is seen by many as a more realistic path to net-zero emissions than breaking up America\u2019s love affair with cars, as Manjoo calls for. But just how realistic is it? Biden\u2019s executive order has no binding authority, and he has resisted calls to set a mandatory timeline for phasing out combustion engines, as the European Union has proposed and as California and Massachusetts have committed to doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the Biden administration plans to impose a set of emissions regulations it hopes will compel automakers to phase out gas-powered cars. But under the administration\u2019s current plan, those regulations \u2014 which officials say will be legally challenging to write \u2014 won\u2019t take effect until 2026. In the meantime, the administration plans only to restore emissions standards to about the levels that existed under President Barack Obama but were weakened during the Trump administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That timeline has drawn criticism from some analysts and activists. \u201cVoluntary pledges from auto companies make a New Year\u2019s resolution to lose weight look like a legally binding contract,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign. \u201cGlobal warming is burning forests, roasting the West and worsening storms. Now is not the time to propose weak standards and promise strong ones later.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the near term, the E.V. transition will depend on whether Americans are willing to make the switch. \u201cPossibly the biggest hurdle ahead is consumer acceptance,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto-data firm Edmunds, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWhat will it take for Americans to be willing to change their car ownership habits to go electric?\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One major obstacle to widespread adoption is anxiety over running out of power, as charging stations are still much sparser than gas ones. Another obstacle is expense: While E.V.s are cheaper for consumers in the long run, they can cost up to $10,000 more than their gas-powered counterparts upfront.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate passed this week would authorize only $7.5 billion to build charging stations across the country, half of Biden\u2019s original request, and it does not expand incentives for E.V. purchases. Automakers have said widespread adoption cannot happen without such investments. Democrats are aiming to incorporate more E.V.-related spending into their reconciliation bill, but its future remains uncertain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government could also spur adoption by raising the tax on gasoline, as the editorial boards of The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times have urged, but the Biden administration has called the idea \u201ca nonstarter.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without these big carrots and sticks, the E.V. transition could extend well beyond 2050. \u201cIf automakers phased out sales of new internal combustion engines, it\u2019s possible that older gasoline-powered cars might persist for even longer on the roads, as consumers who are unable to afford newer, pricier electric cars instead turn to cheaper used models and drive them more,\u201d The Times\u2019s Ivan Penn and Niraj Chokshi write.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that reason, some analysts argue that America\u2019s car fleet will have to shrink as it electrifies. \u201cIf electric vehicles are to play a major role in solving the climate crisis \u2014 which they must \u2014 they have to be paired with dramatic land use reform that shortens or eliminates a substantial portion of all vehicle trips, and replaces them with transit, walking, biking, shared vehicles, and other forms of mobility,\u201d writes Matthew Lewis, the director of communications at California YIMBY.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the car is still king</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it was difficult to imagine a sweeping overhaul of public transportation in the United States before the pandemic \u2014 in 2019, just 5 percent of American commuters used public transit to get to work \u2014 it\u2019s even more difficult now. The coronavirus pushed ridership and revenue off a cliff last year, and they still haven\u2019t recovered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decline was a global phenomenon, prompting a rapid investment in cycling infrastructure in some countries. But in the United States, the coronavirus has for the most part only strengthened the bond between Americans and their automobiles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf commuters shun public transit for cars as their cities recover from the pandemic, that has huge implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d The Times reported in March. \u201cMost importantly, if transit systems continue to lose passenger fare revenues, they will not be able to make the investments necessary to be efficient, safe and attractive to commuters.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate infrastructure bill allocates about three times the amount of money for highways as it does for public transit. To some, like The Urban Institute\u2019s Yonah Freemark, that\u2019s a big missed opportunity. \u201cThe bill does not seem likely to produce the conditions for a movement of Americans away from driving and toward other modes like transit, walking, and biking,\u201d he told The Verge. \u201cThe bill provides next to nothing for non-motorized modes of transportation.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E.V.s may not be the ideal climate solution, but they\u2019re the one Americans have to work with for now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do you have a point of view we missed?

He touted the U.S. global response, which includes an investment of more than $15 billion, as a \"dose of hope\" and said he would announce additional commitments at a virtual COVID-19 summit Wednesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our security, our prosperity and our very freedoms are interconnected as never before. And so, I believe, we must work together as never before,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He reiterated that climate change is a \"code red for humanity,\" anticipating the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, next month. Biden announced he would work with Congress to double his commitment of $5.7 billion per year to help developing countries cope with the effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'Back at the table'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden, who's faced questions over U.S. credibility in the wake of the American military's withdrawal from Afghanistan, emphasized his administration's commitment to rebuilding alliances, including by reassuring NATO and European leaders and rejoining multilateral agreements that his predecessor, Donald Trump, left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and spur global action and shared challenges,\" Biden said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also used the diplomatic speech to underscored that the United States is \"not seeking a new Cold War,\" a message directly aimed at China.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,\" he said in a message probably aimed at China, though he didn't explicitly mention Beijing. \"All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships, so they do not tip from responsible competition into conflict.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shadow of COVID-19 looms large over the annual summit, which took place virtually last year. But the event also comes as the Biden administration also struggles to contain the fallout from a series of diplomatic blunders, including a chaotic and deadly evacuation in Afghanistan after the Taliban swept to power last month. The Pentagon acknowledged Friday that 10 civilians, including an aid worker and as many as seven children, were killed in a drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, in the final days of the 20-year war.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>France recalled its ambassador to the United States and Australia after it was rattled by a new partnership between the two countries and the U.K. that rendered a French submarine contract obsolete.

Jesse Helms, U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to hammer out an agreement for the United States to pay its dues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As vice president, Biden frequently met with foreign leaders at the annual summit and engaged in what Lyon described as \"cocktail napkin diplomacy\" on the sidelines of the General Assembly. He sat in for President Barack Obama in a number of sessions, including one on combating the Islamic State terrorist group in 2015, and co-chaired a U.N. peacekeeping summit in 2014.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Biden himself is prone to cooperation and collaboration and values that work historically,\" Lyon said. \"So a lot of us are puzzled that the Biden administration seems to contradict their own narrative, their own story about cooperation as being important and essential and yet not working multilaterally.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president took office with years of foreign policy experience and global standing that provided a familiar balm to those alarmed by the four years of Trump's \"America first\" isolationist foreign policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the early months, Biden tried to reassure allies by reversing some of his predecessor's policies, including recommitting to the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and launching negotiations about rejoining the nuclear deal with Iran. In his first foreign trip abroad, Biden sought to rebuild international relations at the G-7 summit in Cornwall, followed by a meeting with NATO leaders at the headquarters in Brussels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Trump is gone\u2019 but lingering: As Biden vows \u2018America is back,\u2019 allies wonder for how long</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The goodwill generated by his election, as well as by his initial statements about America's renewed international engagement, has all been evaporated,\" said Brett Bruen, a former foreign service officer who worked on global engagement in the Obama administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president acknowledged that \"no democracy is perfect, including the United States,\" but he said the country would \"continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diplomatic rough patch</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House bristled at criticism that Biden will have to rebuild U.S. credibility in New York this week. A senior administration official insisted before the U.N. speech that the \"picture is actually quite positive\" despite the American exit from Afghanistan and the diplomatic spat with Paris.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's important to note that criticism of a decision is different from criticism of the credibility and leadership of the United States,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday before Biden's speech. \"And if you look back through the course of the last several decades prior to the last administration, there are points of disagreement, including when we have disagreed with the decisions other countries are making, when countries have disagreed with the decisions we're making.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Biden may aspire to be a transformative president abroad to course-correct his predecessor's policies, no single foreign policy issue is more critical than the crises he faces at home, according to Miller.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aides have repeatedly said the president's focus is ending the pandemic and reviving the U.S. economy, but Biden's legacy will also be shaped by whether Congress will pass his infrastructure plan and a spending package that would expand the social safety net \u2013 two bills that Democrats vowed to bring to a vote by the end of the month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He understands that his bandwidth for pursuing grandiose foreign policy and transformative adventures abroad is very limited because governance is about choosing,\" Miller said. \"He understands that the choices are much more consequential at home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lyon said Biden's recent foreign policy moves underscore the president's long-term strategic plan to counter the rise of China as a global power. The hasty Afghanistan exit was about consolidating resources and cutting ties to foreign wars, she said, and the Australian submarine contract is more about Beijing than a slight to the French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That contradicts what Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman envisioned in the creation of the United Nations after World War II, according to Lyon. She said they thought the best way to counter global threats would be to work together through a global institution devoted to peace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's an explanation (for Biden's actions), but it's not one that supports the agenda of the United Nations,\" Lyon said. \"We're working on our second administration that the Americans generally aren't necessarily committed to working with us, and that's what Biden has to overcome.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contributing: Michael Collins</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden to UN: US is shifting from 'relentless war' to relentless diplomacy' amid COVID-19, climate change crises\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

They'll get wealthier, for one. Many of them will add millions more people. And some, like New Orleans, will continue sinking into the ground, thanks to things like erosion or groundwater pumping.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On top of all that, there's sea-level rise to consider. As the world gets warmer, climate scientists expect the oceans to rise somewhere around one foot by 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tally it all up, and flooding is going to become a bigger, more expensive problem for the world's coastal cities. How much bigger? A new study in Nature Climate Change estimates that average annual losses from flooding in the world's biggest coastal cities could rise from about $6 billion per year today to $1 trillion per year by 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's only if cities took no preventative action at all. By contrast, if coastal cities worked to bolster their defenses -- from levees to pumps to movable barriers -- and improved flood monitoring, then the average annual losses go down to $63 billion per year. That's still a big increase, but it's not nearly as steep. (That said, the authors estimate those defenses could cost around $50 billion per year between now and 2050.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tim McDonnell of Climate Desk has put together a helpful map from the data in the study showing the 20 cities facing the highest annual average flooding costs by mid-century. This study builds on previous estimates by taking coastal defenses into account:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States is well-represented here, not least because its cities are so wealthy and have a lot of stuff to damage: New York City faces about $2 billion in annual losses from flooding in 2050, Miami faces $2.5 billion per year, and New Orleans faces $1.8 billion per year. Boston and Tampa Bay are also looking at considerable expenses. Again, this is all assuming these cities improve their flood defenses to maintain \"relative risk levels.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, notice that the city facing the highest absolute costs, by far, is Guangzhou -- and that 5 of the 20 cities facing the steepest flooding costs are located in China. Studies like these may help explain why the Chinese government has placed an increased focus on climate change in recent years.*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's worth noting, however, that climate change is only part of the reason for the increase in flooding risks. The authors estimate that average flood damage would increase to about $52 billion annually even if climate change wasn't a factor at all -- just based on population and economic growth. (As more and more Americans move to the coast, the cost of flooding goes up.) Rising sea levels then add another $11 billion per year on top of that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even that could be a low-end estimate, though: This study is factoring in relatively mild sea-level rise scenarios of just 7.9 inches by mid-century. If the seas rise more, the costs go up. And then there are the years after 2050 to consider. A recent leaked draft of the forthcoming IPCC report suggested that sea levels could rise more than three feet by the end of the century if emissions continue unchecked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also worth taking a look at the map of cities that will see the biggest relative increase in average annual losses between now and 2050 (these aren't absolute costs, but they'll see the biggest change). Many of these cities, like Houston and Istanbul and Athens and Alexandria, don't usually feature prominently in sea-level-rise conversations:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Note that the map above is assuming a relatively mild sea-level rise (7.9 inches by mid-century) and a steady investment in flood-control technology.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Note: Another option is to look at which cities are expected to face the most damage as a percentage of their overall GDP.

Heat days are defined by a combination of factors including temperature, humidity and cloud cover.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have a lot of information about how California broadly has been affected by heat -- we know that heat is increasing and that we're developing a greater and greater number of heat days as climate change gets worse and worse,\" said David Eisenman, co-director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters. \"But the difference really comes down at the neighborhood level.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The parts of L.A. County that show higher rates of ER visits during heat days include the South L.A. corridor down to the ports, the San Pedro area, and the northwest Valley, especially San Fernando and Pacoima, said Eisenman, also a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The findings mirror those outlined in the county's first-ever Climate Vulnerability Assessment, released last fall, which found that social and economic inequality is leaving millions at a disadvantage as the climate crisis worsens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to that report, extreme heat will increase in frequency, severity and duration -- including a potential tenfold increase in the occurrence of heat waves by mid-century. The largest increases will occur in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys, the report says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eisenman said the mapping tool is still in beta testing mode, but the researchers decided to release it this week because California is heading into the hottest and most dangerous time of year. In June last year, a devastating heat wave in the Pacific Northwest was linked to the deaths of at least 1,400 people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although extreme heat has become the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States, a Times investigation found that such deaths are chronically undercounted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a silent killer,\" Eisenman said, noting that unlike disasters such as tornadoes or hurricanes in which the destruction is visible, \"the pictures from before and after a heat wave look exactly the same, so we haven't really gotten the message out that heat is happening.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than 12 million Americans were under excessive heat warnings on Monday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What's more, the agency's most recent seasonal outlook shows a higher likelihood of above-normal temperatures across the western U.S. until at least September.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eisenman said the findings in L.A. County are in some ways not surprising in that they echo the \"decades of redlining\" that have led to differences in shade, access to air conditioning and even base-line health levels in some L.A. communities. Redlining was the institutional practice of denying homeownership and financial services to residents based on race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also noted that many people who visit the ER on heat days aren't there specifically for heat-related illness, but because the heat has exacerbated other underlying health issues such as diabetes, kidney dysfunction and heart disease.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marta Segura, the city of L.A.'s newly appointed \"chief heat officer,\" said in a statement that the heat risk map will help planners \"target resources to the most vulnerable areas exposed to extreme heat and thus prioritize the mitigation and adaptation measures where they are most needed.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among her office's goals are the creation of an early warning system for heat waves, and the development of long-term strategies to reduce heat exposure, such as planting trees and updating building codes, she told The Times last month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The map also shows some surprising variations across the state, with the highest rate of excess daily ER visits from extreme heat in the northwestern counties of Del Norte, Humboldt and Trinity. The California counties with the lowest rate of ER visits are Monterey, Kings and Alpine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eisenman said the reasons for this could be myriad, including that the residents and infrastructure in those northern counties may be less prepared for heat days. There may be fewer houses with air conditioning and also higher numbers of outdoor workers in rural areas, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, the rate of ER visits is only one metric of extreme heat. The counties with the highest number of ER visits during extreme heat days were Los Angeles, San Diego and Alameda, according to the map.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sheer volume of heat-related ER visits in those counties can also help direct the response, Eisenman said, particularly when it comes to staffing and equipment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Our hope is that communities will take this information and call their assemblyman and their city agencies and say: 'What are we doing about this right now?' \" he said. \"Because heat is harming us right now.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: EMMA AGUILAR leaps into the swimming lake at the Hansen Dam Aquatic Center on Monday.

That's because Wyoming has 61 electric charging stations and 330 registered electric vehicles in the state, the study said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Rhode Island has a ratio of 6.24 electric cars to a single charging station.

The remaining five states in the least accessible top 10 include Illinois, Oregon, Florida, Texas and Nevada.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One interesting take is California: the most populous state in the U.S. with nearly 40 million residents, the Golden State has a ratio of 31.20 electric cars to 1 charging station, said the Forbes Advisor study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While California ranks as the fourth least accessible state to charge an EV on the Forbes Advisor list, it ranked as the best state to own an electric vehicle, according to a recent study by SmartAsset.com, a personal finance site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state was the birthplace of popular EV maker Tesla, before its controversial owner Elon Musk pulled up stakes and headed to Austin, Texas, for Tesla's headquarters. Still, California has the most electric vehicles in the U.S., cars which save drivers more than $2,100 in estimated annual fuel savings, the SmartAsset study said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are electric vehicles becoming more mainstream?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, but slowly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Registrations for new EVs soared 60% in the first three months of this year, even though new car registrations slid 18% overall, Automotive News and Car and Driver reported, citing Experian data.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EVs now account for 4.6% of all passenger vehicles being sold in the U.S.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tesla vehicles had the newest EV registrations with 113,882, representing nearly 60% of electric cars registered during that period.

The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has yet to produce a broad, binding, global warming accord that many scientists say would be needed to limit the world's growing carbon output.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other G-20 leaders also endorsed the approach Friday in a joint statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, a Washington-based nonprofit group, called HFCs \"the biggest climate prize available to the world in the next few years.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an e-mail, Zaelke estimated that the accord could cut the equivalent of 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050 and would avoid up to nearly 1 degree in global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This high-level agreement during the G-20 in St. Petersburg shows how effective climate policy can be when it's done at the leader level,\" he wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new effort builds on the accord Obama and Xi struck in June, when they said for the first time that they would work together to persuade other countries to cut HFCs.

Sooty shirts and socks are a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as with even the most modern coal plants, its smokestacks still emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the invisible heat-trapping gas that is the main contributor to global warming. So this fall, a gleaming new maze of pipes and tanks \u2014 topped with what looks like the Tin Man\u2019s hat \u2014 will suck up 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from one of the boilers so it can be shipped out for burial, deep underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is any hope of staving off the worst effects of climate change, many scientists say, this must be part of it \u2014 capturing the carbon that spews from power plants and locking it away, permanently. For now, they contend, the world is too dependent on fossil fuels to do anything less.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If all goes as planned, the effort in Saskatchewan will be the first major one of its kind at a power plant, the equivalent of taking about 250,000 cars off the road. And at least in theory, that carbon dioxide will be kept out of the atmosphere forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThink about how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d said Mr. Zeleny, who recently retired after four decades here, most recently as plant manager.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite President Obama\u2019s push to rein in emissions from power plants across the United States, coal is not going away anytime soon. The administration expects coal will still produce nearly a third of the nation\u2019s electricity in 2030, down from about 40 percent today, even if Mr. Obama\u2019s plan survives the political onslaught against it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The challenge is even more stark overseas. China already burns almost as much coal as all other nations combined, and its appetite keeps expanding. Worldwide, coal consumption in 2020 will be about twice what it was in 2000, according to the United States Energy Information Administration, and will continue to grow for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the abundant natural gas unleashed by fracking, while cleaner than coal, is a major source of greenhouse gases. Ultimately, many scientists say, those emissions will need to be trapped and stored, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you want to carry on using those fossil hydrocarbons, that means cleaning up their emissions,\u201d said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh. Capturing carbon, he said, \u201cis the single best way of doing that.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it is no magic bullet. Because it requires so much energy, sucking up carbon reduces a plant\u2019s ability to make electricity \u2014 the whole point of its existence. There are basic questions of whether carbon dioxide can be safely stored underground. And the technology is expensive. Updating the Saskatchewan plant alone cost $1.2 billion \u2014 two-thirds of which went for the equipment to remove the gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the pine woods of Kemper County, Miss., another carbon-capture effort is taking shape, in a massive new power plant that will be fed a steady diet of coal from the strip mine next door. Bruce Harrington, the operations manager, likened the hulking beast to an anthill: It seems curiously quiet on the outside, but deep within an army of workers is cutting, welding and testing. Disturb it, he said, and thousands of people will come pouring out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Battling delays, the plant\u2019s owner, Southern Company, hopes to have it open next year. But it is more complex than the Saskatchewan effort, and the price tag has ballooned to $5.5 billion, more than double the original estimate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019ll work,\u201d Mr. Harrington said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy at first, but it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though the world has known for decades how to capture carbon dioxide from power plants, scant progress has been made. The United States and other nations have paid for research and helped some projects \u2014 Canada gave $220 million to the Saskatchewan plant\u2019s owner, SaskPower, and Southern Company received $270 million from the Department of Energy \u2014 but the costs are high enough that few other power companies have done much beyond study the concept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere\u2019s no market,\u201d said Edward S. Rubin, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, unless governments impose \u201ca requirement to substantially reduce emissions.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is precisely what is happening here in Saskatchewan, given the Canadian government\u2019s recent restrictions on coal plants both old and new. But whether Mr. Obama\u2019s new rules are aggressive enough to spur a change in the United States remains unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some experts see the Obama policy as a turning point, a moment that could help drive the business of collecting carbon dioxide. Yet the administration has been wary of pushing too hard, warning that any move to force existing coal plants to siphon off their carbon dioxide emissions \u201cwould affect the nationwide cost and supply of electricity.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration plans to require that future coal plants capture their carbon dioxide, a rule that some utilities and politicians, particularly from coal-producing states, have vowed to fight. But for now the mandate is largely an empty one, because coal is so uneconomical compared with natural gas that no one expects many new American coal plants to be built in the foreseeable future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you give power companies a loophole, they\u2019re not going to do the thing,\u201d said Howard J. Herzog, the director of a research program on carbon capture and storage, known as C.C.S., at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cWhy should we even consider C.C.S.? Let\u2019s just do natural gas.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So at a time when many experts say 10 or more projects need to be undertaken to improve the technology and reduce costs, the opposite is happening. Work to modify a coal plant in Texas is expected to start this year, but there are only a few other projects worldwide, all in the planning stage. And as some government subsidies have begun to dry up \u2014 notably, federal stimulus funds in the United States \u2014 several efforts have been delayed or canceled.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Haszeldine said. \u201cGovernments around the world see C.C.S. as a good thing. But they\u2019re not pushing hard enough on enabling that to happen.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Costs</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The technology has been around, in one form or another, for nearly a century, used at some refineries and other industrial plants, including large ones in Illinois, North Dakota, Canada and Norway.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But removing carbon dioxide from the swirl of gases unleashed at a power plant is challenging, akin to plucking just a few colored Ping-Pong balls out of the air from a swarm of mostly white ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To do the job, the equipment is enormous. At the Saskatchewan plant, called Boundary Dam, a liquid chemical latches onto carbon dioxide molecules after being sprayed onto a plume of combustion gases. The \u201cstripper,\u201d where the carbon dioxide is finally pulled away, is 160 feet high \u2014 so high it pokes out of the roof.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the equipment costs, efficiency is lost because some of the steam that would normally generate electricity goes to the stripper instead. And a monstrous motor compresses the carbon dioxide \u2014 until it effectively becomes a liquid \u2014 for transport. All told, capturing the carbon dioxide at Boundary Dam will sap electricity generation by about 20 percent, using as much energy as about 25,000 homes. Experts call it the \u201cenergy penalty.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Storage Concerns</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Injecting liquids deep underground can present problems, too. Pumping wastewater from oil and gas production into the ground has been linked to spates of small earthquakes in Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and other states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The carbon dioxide could taint drinking water, or eventually rise to the surface and bubble into the atmosphere, defeating the entire purpose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the most extreme case, leaking carbon dioxide could harm or kill people. In Cameroon, a volcanic lake suddenly released a cloud of naturally forming carbon dioxide in 1986, suffocating 1,700 people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, carbon dioxide has been buried around the world with few problems. In Norway, a million tons have been stored every year since 1996, injected into sandstone about 3,000 feet beneath the North Sea. (By some estimates, that site alone could store as much carbon dioxide as the world could capture for years.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Picking the right geological features could minimize the risk of earthquakes and leaks. But even then, storage wells would have to be monitored, presumably forever, at a cost someone would have to bear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If done poorly, storing carbon dioxide can cause problems, said David Hawkins, the director of climate programs with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. \u201cBut that\u2019s also true with operating an oil refinery.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An Economic Case</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of Boundary Dam\u2019s carbon dioxide will not simply be buried in storage wells. Instead, the emissions from burning one fossil fuel \u2014 coal \u2014 will become a tool to extract and consume yet another: oil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After being sold and shipped through a 40-mile pipeline to an oil field, the carbon dioxide will be pumped into old wells, where it will mix with the oil inside, making it flow better. The process is known as enhanced oil recovery, and while some of the carbon dioxide will come up with the oil, it will be compressed and injected again. Over time, nearly all of it should remain underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil and gas industry has done this for decades, mostly with naturally occurring carbon dioxide that accumulates underground. But each year in North America, more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide from industry are used as well. Selling that carbon dioxide to the oil industry helps make a business case for capturing it at places like Boundary Dam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The practice could be expanded at many oil fields around the United States and beyond, experts say, potentially storing billions of tons of carbon dioxide and serving as a bridge to the day when it becomes necessary, and economical, to store the gas elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To prod the industry, Congress is weighing incentives, including tax credits, loan guarantees and tax exemptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen by itself,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat who is chairman of a Finance Committee panel on energy. \u201cThere ought to be broad bipartisan support for measures like these.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the apparent incongruity of using carbon dioxide captured from coal to produce more fossil fuels, Mr. Hawkins said his group had struggled with the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOur view is that the most likely consequence is not to encourage more consumption of oil,\u201d he said. Rather, drawing more oil from existing fields will reduce the need to develop new ones, \u201cand that\u2019s an environmental plus,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Future</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Boundary Dam\u2019s owner will evaluate the project for two years before deciding whether to capture carbon dioxide from other boilers at the plant, which it says it could do at lower cost. Part of the calculus is that, less than 10 miles away, there is an almost limitless supply of cheap coal that it otherwise might not be able to use as Canada\u2019s new standards take hold.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe had to figure out if we could continue using coal as a fuel source for the next 100 years,\u201d said Mr. Zeleny, the former employee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the United States and the rest of the world, the prognosis for carbon capture is less clear. If the United States moves forward, China and other countries may make bigger strides as well. This month, the United States and China announced plans for several collaborative research projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHow this will play out over time is hard to tell,\u201d said Professor Rubin of Carnegie Mellon. \u201cInevitably, there will be a balance between technological capability, cost and political realities.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Others were even more upbeat. Dan Reicher, who directs the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University, said the Obama administration\u2019s recent moves on emissions could be a catalyst.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe\u2019re finally getting some clarity on where we\u2019re headed on carbon emissions,\u201d Mr. Reicher said, arguing that collecting carbon dioxide could become a significant industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe need every tool in the toolbox to address climate change,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE BIG FIX: Articles in this series are examining\npotential solutions to climate\nchange.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

And we know what we need to do.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden approved a federal disaster declaration for the area Sunday, and officials warned that toxic waste runoff and sediment from the fire could threaten the watershed around Lake Tahoe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's trip to California reflects not only political imperatives -- he's campaigning for Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is trying to fend off a recall campaign on Tuesday -- but also his administration's increasing focus on wildfires. Biden has participated in regular briefings on the issue, and he's pushing for more spending on infrastructure to mitigate climate change, which scientists say is intensifying forest fires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have not seen this much attention on what I would call good forest management and wildland management as I have with this administration,\" Cal Fire Director Thom Porter said. \"In my 30-year career in this, I haven't seen any attention like this.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom, who greeted Biden when he landed on Air Force One and accompanied him for a briefing on wildfires, praised his commitment with an implicit swipe at former President Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're not sparring partners,\" Newsom said. \"We're working partners.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before arriving in Sacramento, Biden stopped in Boise, Idaho, where he became the first president to visit the National Interagency Fire Center since it was founded five decades ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You know the time of the year when the air fills with smoke and the sky turns a little orange,\" he said in Boise. \"But that time of year is getting earlier every year.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been an estimated 44,000 wildfires this year, with 5.4 million acres burned nationwide.

The state budget allocates $1.5 billion for wildfire prevention work that includes clearing brush and forest management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a meeting with Biden and other governors in late July, Newsom said the state needed more federal support to increase the number of firefighters and improve its fleet of aircraft.

We're here to help. Each Thursday contributor Bjorn Lomborg will provide some important background so readers can have a better understanding of the true effects of climate change and the real costs of climate policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to construct climate disasters. You just find a current, disconcerting trend and project it into the future, while ignoring everything humanity could do to adapt. For instance, one widely reported study found that heat waves could kill thousands more Americans by the end of the century if global warming continues apace\u2014but only if you assume people won't use more air conditioning. Yes, the climate is likely to change, but so is human behavior in response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adaptation doesn't make the cost of global warming go away entirely, but it does reduce it dramatically. Higher temperatures will shrink harvests if farmers keep growing the same crops, but they're likely to adapt by growing other varieties or different plants altogether. Corn production in North America has shifted away from the Southeast toward the Upper Midwest, where farmers take advantage of longer growing seasons and less-frequent extreme heat. When sea levels rise, governments build defenses\u2014like the levees, flood walls and drainage systems that protected New Orleans from much of Hurricane Ida's ferocity this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, many in the media push unrealistic projections of climate catastrophes, while ignoring adaptation. A new study documents how the biggest bias in studies on the rise of sea levels is their tendency to ignore human adaptation, exaggerating flood risks in 2100 by as much as 1,300 times. It is also evident in the breathless tone of most reporting: The Washington Post frets that sea level rise could \" make 187 million people homeless ,\" CNN fears an \" underwater future ,\" and USA Today agonizes over tens of trillions of dollars in projected annual flood damage . All three rely on studies that implausibly assume no society across the world will make any adaptation whatever for the rest of the century. This isn't reporting but scaremongering.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You can see how far from reality these sorts of projections are in one heavily cited study , depicted in the graph nearby If you assume no society will adapt to any sea-level rise between now and 2100, you'll find that vast areas of the world will be routinely flooded, causing $55 trillion in damage annually in 2100 (expressed in 2005 dollars), or about 5% of global gross domestic product. But as the study emphasizes, \"in reality, societies are likely to adapt.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By raising the height of dikes, the study shows that humanity can negate almost all that terrible projected damage by 2100. Only 15,000 people would be flooded every year, which is a remarkable improvement compared with the 3.4 million people flooded in 2000. The total cost of damage, investments in new dikes, and maintenance costs of existing dikes will fall sixfold between now and 2100 to 0.008% of world GDP.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adaptation is much more effective than climate regulations at staving off flood risks. Compare the two types of policies in isolation. Without any climate mitigation to help, dikes would still safeguard more than 99.99% of the flood victims you'd see if global warming continued on current trends. Instead of 187 million people flooded in 2100, there would be only 15,000. Climate policy achieves much less on its own. Without adaptation, even stringent regulations that keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius would reduce the number of flood victims only down to 85 million a year by the end of the century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stringent climate policy still has only a mild effect when used in concert with dikes: Instead of the 15,000 flood victims you'd get with only adaptation, you'd have 10,000. And getting there would cost hundreds of trillions of dollars, which is hardly mitigated by the $40 billion drop in total flood damage and dike costs climate regulations would achieve. As I've explained in these pages before, this kind of policy has a high human cost: the tens of millions of people pricey climate regulations relegate to poverty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You don't have to portend doom to take climate change seriously. Ignoring the benefits of adaptation may make for better headlines, but it badly misinforms readers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.

In addition to rating governments on meaningful financial criteria, in March the biggest of the top three credit-rating firms began to apply an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, rating system.

State officials, including myself, recently wrote a letter to S&P objecting to the ESG indicators and ratings it has assigned to Utah and calling for the company to withdraw them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ESG is sometimes dressed up to look objective with quantitative \"metrics\" and complex \"analytical frameworks.\" But this blurs the distinction between subjective judgments and objective financial assessments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>S&P Global says it \"incorporates [ESG] risks and opportunities into the credit rating analysis\" of public issuers. This includes ambiguous and open-ended categories such as how a state scores on \"managing carbon,\" \"political unrest stemming from community and social issues\" and \"adverse publicity that results in reputation risk.\" Leaving no doubt as to the measurement's subjectivity, S&P notes, \"reflecting ESG risks and opportunities within our credit rating analysis will require a qualitative view of an entity's capacity to anticipate and plan for a variety of emerging risks.\" Unlike quantifiable financial metrics, this qualitative view depends entirely on the beliefs of whoever constructs it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to see that those beliefs are left-wing. S&P assigns a lower ESG score to states that have both \"physical risks\" like earthquakes and natural disasters and a larger percentage of their economy tied to natural resource extraction, such as Texas, Alaska and Louisiana. S&P's Environmental category, after noting federal-state partnerships' financial mitigation of natural disasters, focuses its assessment on the costs of making the transition to \"net zero\" and the policy changes it predicts will be necessary to \"curtail\" greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, if a state's finances are overly concentrated on any one particular industry this will affect its financial outlook because of the risk that revenue could decline should that industry's fortunes contract. But a traditional credit rating takes into account the diversity of industry in a state already, so why create an ESG metric that could be politicized? Instead of focusing on the financial risk associated with economic concentration, the ESG metric highlights if a state or local government allows what S&P thinks is too much oil, gas or coal extraction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further, there are national security, economic and even environmental benefits for U.S. states to produce traditional energy. Many countries are searching for sources of natural gas and oil so they can lower their dependence on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. In that environment, states like Texas, Alaska and Louisiana have a tremendous market advantage and could see improved cash flows. Not only are their fossil fuel revenues benefiting a free democracy, Russia's natural gas exports to Europe burn 41% dirtier than American natural gas. Exporting U.S. natural gas would create a significant environmental benefit. Authoritarian regimes like Russia threaten, among other things, the environment, human rights, free societies and democratic government\u2014all factors that should be important to ESG proponents. That S&P's ESG metrics completely ignored or missed these variables exposes some of the major flaws of ESG ratings. Such scores place a value judgment on political issues that do not have one right or wrong answer, are highly complex, and are impossible to predict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Russian situation has shown, ESG assessments depend on variables that can change rapidly. Before Russia attacked Ukraine, Europe was moving away from fossil fuels and military spending. That changed almost overnight. This is why markets are so valuable; they encapsulate many different views of the future and their organic structure allows for quick adaptation. ESG scores, by contrast, rigidly hold to one viewpoint and are slow to pick up on changes in the world. The minds behind S&P's ESG metrics seem to believe that a transition to green energy is inevitable and therefore punish states that produce traditional energy for \"climate transition risk.\" But no one really knows what this \"climate transition\" will look like. There are no widely accepted, economically viable alternatives to fossil fuels in the market. No one knows where they'll come from, what they'll be or when they'll arrive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ESG metrics' false certainty about future events, and consequent inability to keep up with unanticipated current events, causes capital to be misallocated. They create bubbles in favored industries while starving others that could be profitable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The solutions to our most difficult challenges\u2014such as climate change\u2014can come only through innovation. Foisting rigid ESG factors onto the market discourages innovation by mandating conformity, penalizing creativity and punishing the industry with the greatest incentive to find alternatives\u2014the energy sector. Fracking has reduced U.S. carbon emissions immensely, but it could cost you under S&P's ESG metrics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Utah has prudently managed its finances over decades and as a result maintains the highest possible credit rating from all major firms, allowing the state to borrow money at the lowest rates and save taxpayer dollars. But under the new ESG regime, those financial factors may be supplanted by subjective, political ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These metrics also threaten Utah and other states' democratic sovereignty. The ESG disclosures many corporations have felt compelled to release have also led to frivolous legal action and shareholder resolutions, an additional fiscal drag on businesses. Extending this regime into the municipal sphere is an invitation to litigation and other coercive tactics that will sabotage states' self-determination and independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States like Utah value our constitutional republic, which has ensured freedom, and free markets, which have fostered innovation and generated prosperity for generations. Any states, governmental jurisdictions, corporations, individuals, and investors who also hold those beliefs should join us in standing against ESG.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Oaks is treasurer of Utah.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>S&P Hits U.S. States With Politicized Credit Scores</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Marlo Oaks\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

You recycle. You turn off the faucet when you brush your teeth. But you're not going to forgo a flight to a tropical paradise and top-notch accommodations, even though planes emit greenhouse gases and routine hotel practices, like washing the linens each day, hurt the environment. After all, you love to travel -- and well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's still hope. To help you sleep easier on those high-thread-count sheets, here are 10 small ways to travel a little more responsibly, even when taking that trip to Hawaii.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flying (especially on short flights) is among the least sustainable ways to travel, according to groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund . Some airlines allow you to try to compensate for the carbon footprint you create when flying, however, by buying what are known as carbon offsets, or various ways to reduce greenhouse gases. Passengers on airlines like Delta and United can calculate their carbon footprint on the airline websites, which equate the size of a trip's carbon footprint with a dollar figure. They can then donate their money or miles to a carbon reduction project such as forest conservation or renewable energy. Airlines are not the only ones offering offsets, though. Amtrak , for instance, has a rail calculator and allows you to offset your train trip through Carbonfund.org .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some environmental organizations have said that offset programs are problematic . And a number of them have suggested that the carbon calculators on airline sites are not precise enough because they do not take into consideration factors like whether you're flying first class (which results in a larger carbon footprint because you're taking up space that could otherwise have been used to transport more people). Still, contributing to such programs is better than flying and doing nothing. For a more precise calculator, check out carbonfootprint.com .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you can't walk, bike. If you can't bike, take a subway, bus or train. If you rent a car, request a hybrid. If you hire a driver, try to car pool. Services such as Lyft and Uber offer car-pooling, though the notion that they are environmentally friendly is being studied ; researchers at NRDC Urban Solutions and the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, are analyzing whether such services are good for the environment or if they are merely congesting roads, competing with public transportation and encouraging people to be driven instead of walking. Bottom line: If you have the option, walk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The greenest vacation is one in which you don't travel far, impossible for those who wish to see the world. Airbnb has argued that home sharing is a greener option than hotels, though its study published in 2014 -- which said that using Airbnb results in a significant reduction in energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste, and relied mainly on guest and host survey responses from February to April of that year -- was not scientific. But if home sharing isn't for you, you can still make any hotel stay greener by reusing your sheets and towels (many hotels give guests the option to not change their linens each day), taking short showers, turning off the air-conditioner (or using a fan instead), turning down the thermostat and using less electricity by forgoing the hair dryer and switching off the lights when you're not in the room. You can also choose to stay in hotels that have sustainable practices like harvesting rainwater and not heating or air-conditioning rooms or spaces that are unoccupied. To find them, check out a site like the Green Hotels Association . Expedia.com also has some tips for green travel. Not sure your desired hotel is green? The Nature Conservancy has 10 questions you can ask to find out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millions of barrels of oil are needed to produce the plastic water bottles consumed by Americans alone, according to the Pacific Institute , a sustainable water think tank. In 2007 the group said that the amount of oil used in the production of plastic water bottles was enough energy to fuel more than a million cars and light trucks for a year. You can do your part to curb emissions by always traveling with a reusable bottle. And coffee and tea drinkers can help when it comes to saving paper by carrying reusable travel mugs instead of to-go cups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heavier your luggage, the more fuel is needed. Even something as small as a cellphone multiplied across the number of passengers affects the weight of a plane. Besides, it's easier and more fun to travel when you're not loaded down with bags.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now we know not to print documents when we don't have to, and recycle whatever paper we do use. Paper production and pulpwood harvesting contribute to climate change and \" threaten some of the last remaining natural forests and the people and wildlife that depend on them ,\" according to the WWF . E-tickets, meanwhile, have come a long way from their wonky early days. Having your smartphone scanned at airports and train stations is often seamless.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eat locally sourced food and buy locally made souvenirs -- and carry them back to your hotel in a reusable bag instead of plastic. In addition to supporting local economies, shopping locally generally means there's less packaging. And items don't need to be flown or shipped in, cutting down on waste and greenhouse gas emissions. As the Michigan State University Extension has pointed out, buying locally grown food can help maintain farmland and green space. To cut emissions even more significantly, reduce or eliminate red meat; its production is carbon-intensive .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Allow your computer and other devices to sleep when you're not using them. It's an energy saver that's good for their battery life and for the earth, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many environmentally minded groups including the Nature Conservancy , the Sierra Club and the WWF offer eco-trips and outings that strive not to harm natural resources, wildlife or people. Backroads and REI Adventures also offer tours that aim to be environmentally low-impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pass your green travel habits on to others. You'll multiply their effect -- something you'll need to do given all the trips you hope to take.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/travel/ecotourism-green-travel-tips.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

But it and other megafires in the West have left a footprint much larger than the evergreen forests they level and the towns they decimate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Summer after summer, California, a global leader in battling air pollution from vehicles, sends giant clouds of haze filled with health-damaging particles across the country. Even as far as Denver, 1,100 miles to the east, the Dixie Fire has helped create a pall of noxious smoke during an already scorching summer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By one measure, wildfires \u2014 intensified by drought and climate change \u2014 are the largest source of potentially deadly air pollution in California. And in recent weeks, the accumulating haze and smoke from California\u2019s fires and high ozone levels have turned the air in Salt Lake City and Denver into some of the dirtiest in the world, more harmful than Delhi\u2019s or Beijing\u2019s on many recent days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Smoke from wildfires across western Canada, Oregon and California has stained the skies and fouled the air as far away as Iowa, Minnesota and even New York City. Recent research suggests that the smoke may actually grow more toxic as it ages, undergoes chemical changes and blows across the country, reacting with sunlight and other molecules floating in the air. Over time, smoke may form reactive compounds that can be especially damaging to the body once they are inhaled.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt gets worse with age,\u201d said Mary Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at the Sean N.

What sets the Dixie Fire apart from the megafires of previous years is the vast area it has torn through in the mountains northeast of the state capital, Sacramento. With 489,287 acres burned, the fire is still only 21 percent contained.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the exhausted firefighters battling the Dixie Fire in and around Gold Rush towns are warning that the season of smoke and fire could grip the drought-stricken West for months to come.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

Improving auto fuel efficiency standards threaten to depress oil consumption eventually, and fleets of electric vehicles are gradually emerging in China and a few other important markets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps most troubling for oil companies over the long term is the goal \u2014 agreed to last December by virtually every country in the world at a climate conference in Paris \u2014 of staving off a rise in average global temperatures of more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, has said that to reach that goal, two-thirds of the global coal, oil and natural gas reserves still underground may never be burned without some improbable technological breakthrough in dealing with the carbon emissions. This position has been echoed by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil industry has experienced global crises, booms and busts for over a century, and few energy experts think it faces an existential threat in the immediate future. The world will still need oil and gas for decades, and normal declines in existing fields oblige further drilling. But change is almost certainly coming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAny energy company in the world that makes its strategy without considering climate change policies is making a major mistake,\u201d Mr. Birol said in an interview, \u201cnot only a major mistake for the climate but also for their own profits and for their own shareholders, because climate change policies represent a fundamental challenge to business as usual.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Energy Agency\u2019s projections of future global oil demand include one possibility in which demand could drop more than 20 percent from today\u2019s levels, to 74 million barrels a day by 2040, if measures are put in place to keep global warming at levels proposed at the Paris conference. As coal burning declines precipitously and renewable energy grows steadily, natural gas demand will rise only modestly by 2040 even as the global population grows, if the world truly wants to come to grips with climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, many oil executives view a different path as more likely. Exxon Mobil , for example, projects that global demand for oil will keep growing \u2014 by just over 13 percent from today, to 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and many other companies are investing heavily in natural gas as a lower-carbon answer to growing global energy needs. They view gas as a clean fuel of the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe continue to believe fossil fuels will have a significant and important role to play for as far as we can see,\u201d Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, said at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in May.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which way the world will turn is still in doubt. Most oil executives and independent experts agree that the ambitious Paris target will be challenging to reach, and that reduced burning of fossil fuels will require big technological and policy shifts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Governments will probably need to be more proactive in deploying nuclear power, which is virtually carbon-free, many experts say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coal-fired power plants will need to be equipped with costly carbon capture and sequestration systems. Higher prices for carbon-based fuels are needed in countries like the United States to depress demand and encourage investments in nuclear power and carbon capture and sequestration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Advanced biofuels must be developed to produce renewable fuels without competing with food supplies. Better and cheaper batteries are needed to make electric cars affordable, while recharging stations need to be deployed far more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of those strategies are costly, politically charged or technically challenging. Big scientific breakthroughs will be needed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oil companies have tried to offer solutions to remain relevant. Exxon Mobil, for instance, has financed research into carbon capture and sequestration and lobbied for a carbon tax. Shell has been a big investor in Brazilian biofuels, while Chevron has long been one of the biggest investors in geothermal energy. The French oil company Total is making a major effort in solar power .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco, pledged last week to jointly invest $1 billion over the next decade to develop systems to capture and store emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several oil and gas companies have already moved quickly to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from their exploration and transmission operations. Some farsighted executives have even suggested that their natural gas production could eventually be a major source of hydrogen for fuel cells because methane is hydrogen-rich.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it\u2019s just a start. With their scientific and engineering prowess and capital muscle, many oil companies have the capacity to retrofit their business plans if and when they are forced to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeremy Bentham, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s vice president for global business environment, said Shell and other oil companies could adapt and prosper to meet the world\u2019s energy needs, which should continue to grow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cOur portfolio mix would adjust over time,\u201d he said, \u201csuch that the level of the demand for oil would be met and the level of demand for overall energy would be met.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bentham acknowledged that the world must leave some fossil fuels in the ground, but that the global community and not just oil companies must take action to reduce demand for carbon-based fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cTo have a demand at a much lower level you need a significant restructuring of mobility systems with more compact cities and with more public transport that can be electrified,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles that can take a longer range \u2014 a whole restructuring that isn\u2019t driven by energy production.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The restructuring of a new energy system is years if not decades away, and signs that important change is coming have been uneven.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The electric car market is growing slowly in the United States and most of Europe because of high costs and range limitations, although it is advancing faster in China. Toyota, Hyundai and Honda already offer hydrogen fuel-cell cars in select markets, and other companies are testing models that would emit nothing but water from the tailpipe, but major market penetration could be decades away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automobiles are becoming far more efficient, although cheap gasoline is causing a surge in consumer demand in the United States for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the petroleum industry, even as the price of oil has ticked up modestly in recent months, there are multiple signs of stress in a world of cheap hydrocarbons and rising environmental concerns. What once looked like a rush to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic has stalled . Investments in Canada\u2019s oil sands have slowed, partly as a result of low commodity prices, but also because environmentalists have been successful in opposing the Keystone XL and other pipelines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, the hydraulic fracturing revolution that led to a frenzy of drilling in the United States is taking off in Argentina , but hardly anywhere else. The collapse in oil and natural gas prices has led to scores of bankruptcies, mounting debts and the slashing of exploration budgets. Attorneys general in several states are investigating charges that Exxon Mobil raised doubts about climate change while its scientists warned about the dangers of carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this new world, European companies have been relatively more responsive to change. Many have embraced shareholder proposals to acknowledge the need to limit the rise in global temperatures and to test operations to see how they would perform in a carbon-constrained world. Such proposals have mostly been rejected by the American majors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statoil, the Norwegian national company, has agreed to accelerate its investments in renewable energy, announcing new investment decisions totaling more than $1 billion. Among these are the world\u2019s first floating offshore wind park and one of the world\u2019s largest venture funds dedicated to renewables .

The two sides are squaring off over a U.S. Bureau of Land Management plan to allocate some 10 million acres of public land in the California desert for conservation, recreation and clean-energy installations like the 550-megawatt, or million watt, Desert Sunlight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The solar lobby argues that the current draft plan would throttle the industry's expansion, making it difficult to meet the nation's renewable-energy goals. Environmentalists want to preserve \"connectivity\" between areas of vital species habitat so that tortoises and other animals can move around and adjust to warming conditions, which could drive them to higher, cooler elevations. For the animals, reaching distant mountain ranges might mean crossing flat stretches where, otherwise, companies might put solar installations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal would allocate 388,000 acres of federal land for renewable-energy development, while protecting 5.3 million acres for conservation reasons and 3.8 million acres for recreation. (The last two involve some overlap.) \"Over twice the amount of important desert tortoise lands\" would be protected under the plan, the agency determined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Why the administration would on one hand call for greater use of renewable energy on public lands as a way to hit carbon-reduction targets while cutting off access to the land needed ... is lost on us,\" said Dan Whitten, vice president for communications at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the main trade group of the booming solar industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The industry's stance on the initiative - dubbed the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan - has in turn triggered criticism in the conservation world and spurred a counter-mobilization in the plan's favor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We've been at this for eight years. The industry has been at the table, and to have these issues come up ... at the 11th hour seems a bit not only mystifying but disingenuous on their part for not bringing them up earlier,\" said Ileene Anderson, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of a number of prominent environmental groups backing the plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An 'umbrella' species</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's behind it all is a desert that, far from being deserted, is in high demand - presenting a complex patchwork of urban areas, national parks and monuments, military bases, lands of major cultural significance to Native Americans, and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a branch of the Interior Department, has been charged with managing 10 million publicly owned acres of this landscape since 1976, a period that coincided with a steady decline in the population of the tortoise, a long-lived and slow-reproducing reptile that digs telltale burrows in the dry earth to keep cool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tortoise is threatened by roads, off-road vehicles and other factors - including a changing climate. It is considered an \"umbrella\" species because its habitat overlaps with so many others. \"By protecting the tortoise, you protect all the other species in the desert,\" said Mark Massar, a wildlife biologist with the BLM.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Concern for the tortoise mounted as the desert solar boom hit in the late 2000s, buoyed by President Obama's economic stimulus act and California's ever-more-ambitious targets for renewable energy, which currently require power companies to get 50 percent of their electricity from clean sources by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conflicts were epitomized by the Ivanpah solar plant in the Mojave Desert. One environmental group, the Western Watersheds Project, sued the federal government in 2011 to stop the solar project. That didn't happen, but developers ultimately had to spend millions of dollars to protect desert tortoises at and around the site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is in this context that the BLM began a protracted process to apportion the land, collaborating with federal and California partner agencies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For renewable energy, one of the largest designated areas lies in eastern Riverside County, halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix along Interstate 10. The region, called the Chuckwalla Valley, is part of a dry, harsh landscape that once supported massive World War II training exercises overseen by Army Gen. George S. Patton, who was preparing an Allied invasion force to go into North Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One advantage of this valley is that it contains many hot, low-lying areas that are less-desirable habitat for tortoises, which prefer higher elevations. Even conservationists say they are okay - mostly - with solar installations out here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a pretty decent area to be what you might call a sacrifice area for solar,\" Joan Taylor, a longtime desert conservation advocate who chairs the Sierra Club's California/Nevada Desert Committee, said as she surveyed Desert Sunlight recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>'More than enough acres'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The solar-energy industry has moved quickly to lay claim to the area. To the east of Desert Sunlight, near the Arizona border, NextEra is finishing construction on another large array, the two-part Blythe project, a 235-megawatt installation covering more than three square miles. Surrounding the facility are not one but two fences. One of the fences extends 18 inches below ground to prevent desert tortoises from burrowing beneath it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But solar-energy backers fear that finding other suitable sites may be difficult under the federal plan. One charge is that some of the renewable-energy zones overlap with ecologically sensitive areas, such as sand dunes that are home to the Mojave fringe-toed lizard, and \"microphyll woodlands,\" areas of taller trees, like ironwood and palo verde, that are key for birds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Danielle Mills, a senior policy adviser for the Large-scale Solar Association, recently toured one of these woodlands, which grow in desert washes that receive occasional flooding, near the Blythe array.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Companies wouldn't come here in the first place, but on top of that, there's a requirement to avoid it,\" said Mills, whose organization's members include NextEra and First Solar, which originally developed Desert Sunlight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The BLM does not dispute that overlaps exist. Even within designated development areas, \"there's still going to be some sensitive resources that are going to have to be avoided,\" said Mike Sintetos, who leads the BLM's renewable-energy program in California. \"We acknowledge that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sintetos said the agency thinks there will still be \"more than enough acres available for the amount of megawatts that we think are going to come out of the desert.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The wind-energy industry is not happy with the plan, either. \"I've never been so frustrated in my entire life. It was like beating my head against a brick wall for seven years,\" said Nancy Rader, executive director of the California Wind Energy Association.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But conservationists counter that California's two large utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, have voiced support for the plan. And BLM California spokeswoman Martha Maciel adds that by channeling the solar industry to areas that are less conflict-prone, development will be a lot easier and litigation rarer. \"It provides them a level of certainty that does not exist today,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How much is needed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One key point of disagreement is just how much additional solar-energy infrastructure California, and the rest of the United States, will need - and how much should be sited on public lands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Karen Douglas, one of the California Energy Commission's five members, argues that the 388,000 acres should be more than enough - especially considering that the solar-energy industry will have the option to develop on private lands, too, and in other parts of the state, such as the San Joaquin Valley.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She described a scenario in which, assuming that California will need 20,000 megawatts of desert renewable energy by 2040, 12 percent of the federal lands designated under the plan would supply about 40 percent of the goal. Private lands could then accommodate the rest, she said. \"Large-scale renewable energy, especially on public land, is not the only game in town,\" Douglas said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the solar industry counters that it doesn't know how much private land will be available. Originally, the plan was to work with California's counties to simultaneously obtain private land and allocate public lands. But later, the plan was split to pursue separate tracks, one factor that is now driving discord.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate marks a clear coming of age for the solar industry, a sign that the growing appetite for the energy it produces will begin to conflict with other interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no free ride with energy,\" said the Sierra Club's Taylor. \"They all have costs, and large-scale solar is among them.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>chris.mooney@washpost.com\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 10}

Leading politicians in the state, from the governor down to many mayors, have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, backing industry over environmental concerns, said easing emissions rules would help stimulate auto manufacturing. He vowed \n last week \n to loosen the regulations. Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of supporting stricter standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But California can write its own standards because of a longstanding waiver granted under the Clean Air Act , giving the state \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest auto market \u2014 major sway over the auto industry. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D.C., follow California\u2019s standards, a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAll of the evidence \u2014 call it science, call it economics \u2014 shows that if anything, these standards should be even more aggressive,\u201d said the board member Daniel Sperling, a transportation expert at the University of California, Davis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The board\u2019s chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, was even more pointed, admonishing automakers for milking Mr. Trump for favors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s take action today, and let\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long a forerunner in environmental regulation, California worked with the Obama administration on joint standards that became a crucial part of the country\u2019s effort to combat climate change . Officials said the regulations would reduce the country\u2019s oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and eliminate six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution over the lifetime of the cars affected. That amounts to more than a year\u2019s worth of America\u2019s carbon emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adopted in 2012, the standards would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54.5 miles per gallon, forcing automakers to speed development of highly fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars . Mr. Trump intends to lower that target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday\u2019s unanimous vote by the 14-member board, which affirmed the higher standards through 2025, amounted to a public rejection of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, the question is how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the Trump administration will handle California\u2019s dissent. The administration could choose to revoke California\u2019s waiver, at which point experts expect the state would sue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California sued the George W. Bush administration after it challenged California\u2019s waiver in 2007. Mr. Obama reversed the federal challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House and the E.P.A., which have not yet determined their plans for the California waiver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several states that follow California\u2019s rules raced to its defense. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way together,\u201d said Steven Flint, director of the air resources division of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. \u201cWe\u2019re with you, and we believe in what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists and public health experts have criticized the automakers\u2019 resistance to emissions rules under the Trump administration as an about-face. All major automakers previously voiced support for the more stringent standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nation\u2019s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d for the auto industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion by 2025 to comply.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A separate study by the International Council on Clean Transportation , a think tank supporting emissions controls, has estimated that the cost of meeting those standards could be overstated by as much as 40 percent. And auto industry experts have warned that a slowdown in America\u2019s shift toward efficient cars could leave its auto market a global laggard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, an industry trade group, said before the California vote that companies agreed on the need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. But he urged California to fall into line with federal rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is a more effective way forward than regulatory systems that are different,\u201d Mr. Bozzella said. He also suggested that demand for clean cars remained relatively tiny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was required, he said, were standards that \u201cbalance innovation, compliance and consumer needs and wants.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automakers have also been critical of a California\u2019s zero-emission vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of electric cars and trucks in California and nine other states. The board voted on Friday to continue that program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Politicians in California, one of the country\u2019s most Democratic states, have embraced acting as a bulwark against Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, promising to defend the state\u2019s laws on immigration, health care and the environment. Many cities in California have broad \u201csanctuary\u201d policies aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. State law also provides some protections for immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even at the federal level, the president\u2019s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration would then need to propose its own replacement fuel-economy standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the Trump administration\u2019s move to ease emissions rules is the first part of an expected \n ass \n a \n u \n lt on Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will direct the E.P.A. to dismantle Obama-era regulations on pollution from coal-fired power plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not think carbon dioxide is a primary cause of global warming, a statement at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bonnie Holmes-Gen of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe public is bearing a huge cost \u2014 billions of dollars in health expenses and damage from climate,\u201d Ms. Holmes-Gen said. \u201cI urge California to keep us on track.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about California\u2019s upholding its auto emissions standards misstated the position that Steven Flint holds at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. He is director of the air resources division, not the director of the department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/energy-environment/california-upholds-emissions-standards-setting-up-face-off-with-trump.html?partner=bloomberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: HIROKO TABUCHI\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}
{"id": "txt/1716193956.xml.txt", "text": "<div id='source_options'><p>Pope Francis|Pope|Roman Catholic Church|N/A|Religious leader|Pope Francis is referenced for his views on social issues and the dignity of individuals, emphasizing the importance of 'religious liberty.'</p><p>Ben Rhodes|Deputy National Security Adviser|Obama administration|N/A|Bureaucrat|Ben Rhodes is considering the alignment of the Obama administration's work with the values emphasized by Pope Francis.</p><p>Barack Obama|President|United States of America|N/A|Politician|President Obama is quoted praising Pope Francis for his support on environmental protection and diplomatic relations with Cuba.</p></div><div><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EVEN BEFORE he became the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, Pope Francis had fashioned a more political agenda in visiting Washington than his predecessors. Like popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II before him, Pope Francis toured the city and warmly greeted many of the thousands of faithful who turned out to see him under brilliant blue skies. But his popular outreach was matched with remarkably pointed messages to the political establishment that gathered to hear him at the Capitol and the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pope Francis's first political pitch arguably came when he introduced himself as the \"son of an immigrant family\" and called the United States a country \"largely built by such families.\" Soon afterward he delighted President Obama by explicitly praising his climate change policies. Then he called for the defense of \"religious liberty . . . from everything that would threaten or compromise it.\" In case anyone was uncertain what he meant by that, the pontiff later made an unscheduled stop at the home of the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have led the fight against the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before Congress, Pope Francis returned to the subjects of immigration and global warming, along with prison reform and the death penalty, the arms trade, wealth inequality and even the role of money in the political system. He was particularly forceful in urging acceptance of immigrants, saying that in view of the \"thousands [who] travel north in search of a better life,\" Americans \"must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The political messages were particularly striking in view of the pope's performance in Cuba, his previous stop, where he said nothing about political or religious freedom. That, too, was a contrast with Pope John Paul II, who spoke explicitly about human rights when he toured the island in 1998. Perhaps Pope Francis believed that the open U.S. political system allowed him to speak more freely than in Communist-ruled Cuba without offending the local political authorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, some of the pope's Washington hosts appeared eager to take advantage of his words. \"How can we make use of the enormous platform that the pope's visit provides to lift up the work we're doing and demonstrate how it's consistent with the direction that's coming from the pope?\" is the way deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes put it. Mr. Obama certainly tried, telling Pope Francis that \"you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet\" and thanking him for \"invaluable\" support in his administration's renewal of relations with Cuba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional Republicans cheered when the pope obliquely mentioned his opposition to abortion, and some will seize on his references to \"religious freedom\" in the context of Obamacare. We'd like to hope the Republican presidential debate, which has been poisoned by Donald Trump's ugly and false attacks on migrants from Mexico, might be swayed by the pope's compassion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all likelihood, however, it won't be. In the past, popes have had the most political impact when they spoke up for people who were silenced; think of Pope John Paul II in Communist Poland. In the United States, there is no shortage of advocates -- and opponents -- of Pope Francis's various stands.

The fill sinks naturally, and the subsidence worsens as the water table rises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Investigators are just beginning to try to unravel what caused the Champlain Towers South to collapse into a heap of rubble, leaving at least 159 people missing as of Friday. Experts on sea-level rise and climate change caution that it is too soon to speculate whether rising seas helped destabilize the oceanfront structure. The 40-year-old building was relatively new compared with others on its stretch of beach in the town of Surfside.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it is already clear that South Florida has been on the front lines of sea-level rise and that the effects of climate change on the infrastructure of the region \u2014 from septic systems to aquifers to shoreline erosion \u2014 will be a management problem for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Champlain Towers South building was recently found to have been sinking in the 1990s and may have continued to sink since then, according to Shimon Wdowinski, a professor at Florida International University's department of earth and environment who has studied the area.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wdowinski co-wrote a paper published in April 2020 that said satellite imagery showed a 12-story condominium building in the eastern part of the Miami Beach area had sunk by about two millimeters per year between 1993 and 1999. Wdowinski said in an interview Thursday that it was the Champlain Towers South building.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I was shocked to see it collapsed,\" Wdowinski said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Land subsidence is a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the surface when material that supports it is displaced or removed, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Erosion and the disappearance of groundwater are two of several factors that cause it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wdowinski, whose findings were first reported by USA Today, cautioned that it was not clear whether the subsidence he found was connected to the building's collapse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It appears to be something very localized to one building, so I would think the problem was more likely to be related to the building itself,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The roof on the 136-unit building was being replaced and other repairs were planned, according to an attorney for the condominium association, Kenneth Direktor. He said the building was \"thoroughly inspected\" recently as part of a process in which buildings in Surfside must be recertified every 40 years and that the report on the inspection had been completed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There was nothing in the report that would have indicated a life-safety concern,\" Direktor said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jim McGuinness, Surfside's building official, said the city was aware that the report was close to being completed but that officials were still awaiting its submission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miami and nearby beach communities have experienced substantial sea-level rise, up to 12 inches over the past century, according to some estimates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That includes nearly six inches since the mid-1990s, according to a Capital Weather Gang analysis of federal data. That has led to a 320 percent jump in nuisance flooding in the area over the past 23 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a new storm-water master plan released by the city of Miami in April, it would have to spend nearly $4 billion over the next 40 years to protect the city from floods that result from sea-level rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The money would be spent on six-foot-high sea walls, massive underground pipes and wells to control a rapid influx of water. Regardless of how much the city spends, some residents would have to retreat from areas that cannot be protected from flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The porous limestone underneath Miami allows the rising seas to filter up through the ground, causing flooding during high tides even on sunny days. The groundwater surge threatens freshwater supplies and septic systems, which are already failing in Miami-Dade County.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mix of swelling groundwater and tidal cycles juiced by climate change means coastal buildings and their concrete foundations spend more time in water than they did in the past, said Albert Slap, the chief executive of RiskFootprint, a Boca Raton, Fla.-based company that assesses buildings' vulnerability to hazards such as storm surge and flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is a tragic, devastating event, and it could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine-type event,\" he said. \"It's not just one building. This could be something that could affect other buildings.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Slap noted that many coastal structures built on sand that have underground parking lots already rely on around-the-clock sump pumps to keep out groundwater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The groundwater enters the pores of the concrete and ultimately weakens it and erodes it,\" he said. \"So the foundations are subject to a lot of geological forces that could compact the soil underneath. It could cause voids. We just don't know.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Video from the scene of the collapse showed rescue workers in the basement parking garage working in knee-deep water, although the source of that water was unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harold R. Wanless, a professor at the University of Miami and an expert on sea-level rise, cautioned that there are too many other possible explanations for the building collapse to speculate whether sea-level rise played a role in the tragedy. But investigators need to get to the bottom of that, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We've got to find out what it is,\" he said, \"because it makes living or working in high-rises very unattractive right now. Why did this happen?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wanless said the area of the collapse in Surfside was still a few feet above normal sea level. One of the possibilities that must be taken into consideration is whether a sinkhole or some type of collapse happened under the building, he said, but he added that the area has not been known for sinkholes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"About 20 feet down is limestone, but that's not an area that has had any sinkholes that I'm aware of,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A search of the Florida Geologic Survey's site for sinkhole reports in the area of the building's address on Collins Avenue yields no results. Unlike Miami, which is more prone to sinkholes, Miami Beach is an area where the FGS says \"sinkholes are few, shallow, of small diameter and develop gradually.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no reason for this building to go down like that, unless someone literally pulls out the supports from underneath, or they get washed out, or there's a sinkhole or something like that, because it just went down,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said at a news conference Thursday morning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another Surfside official, Commissioner Eliana R. Salzhauer, also questioned whether the land underneath the building had been compromised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think this is all tied to sea-level rise and our overdevelopment,\" she said. \"And Mother Earth comes back, and the ocean comes back, and takes it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miami has also long suffered from \"king tides,\" higher-than-normal tides caused by alignments of the sun and moon that have been exacerbated by rising sea levels from melting glaciers and polar ice. These tides, which tend to be strongest in the fall, have routinely caused flooding in the city.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Army Corps of Engineers recently proposed a $6 billion sea wall up to 20 feet high running six miles along the coast to protect against storm surge. It would not cover Surfside, nor would it protect from tidal flooding elsewhere in the city.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tim Craig contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

The GOP House of Representatives didn't take much time to reject their advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic facts,\" the former EPA heads wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our world continues to warm, with the last decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean warming faster than the earth's atmosphere. Sea level is rising. Arctic Sea ice is melting years faster than projected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of scientific evidence grow only stronger and more numerous. And the window of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay could mean that warming becomes \"locked in.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of responding with command-and-control rulemaking in which government reorders the economy by regulatory fiat, they point out, Congress should marshal the power of the market in the battle against climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Make people pay something for the emissions for which they are responsible, and you will get fewer emissions when and where consumers and businesses decide they are worth cutting. No command; no control. And the government could limit the effects on individual consumers and the general economy by rebating the revenues back to them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's just one problem: \"That is unachievable in the current political gridlock in Washington.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As if to drive that point home, the House on Friday morning passed a measure that would require Congress's approval for any carbon-taxing scheme that President Obama might try to impose by regulation, even though the White House has said it has no plans to propose one. More than anything, the symbolic vote seemed to be about trying to associate Democrats with a policy that has been a big target of GOP demagoguery, no matter how many outside experts say it's a good idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Friday's Times op-ed reminds us, there used to be a strong element in the Republican Party that was able to advocate for economically literate environmental policy. George H.W. Bush, after all, was the president who introduced market-based environmentalism into federal law, enacting a very-successful cap-and-trade program to combat acid rain. Now, the GOP's approach to the environment is dominated by those who go out of their way to repudiate good policy, use it as a political weapon, or both at the same time.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 1}

China did not commit to a new timetable for reducing emissions, nor did it set a ceiling for how much its emissions would rise before they started to fall.

The landmark agreement covers about 85 percent of the world\u2019s forests, which are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twelve governments committed $12 billion, and private companies pledged $7 billion, to protect and restore forests in a variety of ways, including $1.7 billion for Indigenous peoples.

He\u2019s the California Climate Fellow for the Nature Conservancy, a researcher, and the expert behind the Weather West blog.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I initially wanted to talk to Mr. Swain about wildfires \u2014 their increasing severity and frequency \u2014 but, he explained, fire and rain and floods are part of climate cycles that are becoming more extreme.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe average condition doesn\u2019t characterize what you experience,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Average temperatures are rising, he said, and what\u2019s starting to become clear is that \u201cthe impacts of those warming temperatures are not incremental in living systems.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An average over years doesn\u2019t capture the real effects of a devastating drought and wildfires followed closely by a particularly wet rainy season on environments and communities, which are increasingly being built into wilderness areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, Mr. Swain said, Californians end up dealing with \u201cthe worst of both worlds.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question then becomes: How do you manage land use to minimize harm from extreme weather? Is it possible to store water when it rains and save it for when the state is wracked with drought?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be simple to, say, return it all to its natural state. Rip out the concrete in the Los Angeles River, let wildfires burn what they will, never allow construction where there\u2019s any risk of disaster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Swain said it\u2019s impossible to ignore the presence of humans or to discount the value of communities that have already been built \u2014 even if they coexist with the environment imperfectly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going forward, he said, there are opportunities to build more sustainably, and for policymakers to think carefully about managing things like groundwater.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For now, though, Mr. Rowe, of the National Weather Service, said that another storm could be heading toward the Central Coast next week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re following</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was asked to weigh in on an issue Wednesday that hasn't really penetrated the 2020 presidential race to date: global population control. But his answer rekindles a decades-old debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During CNN's climate change town halls Wednesday night, a teacher named Martha Readyoff asked Sanders if he would support making population control part of his climate-change agenda. And Sanders said he would:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>READYOFF: Good evening. Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face. Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SANDERS: Well, Martha, the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that are \u2014 that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control, to me is totally absurd. So I think, especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies, and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, it's something I very, very strongly support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders's comments drew almost instant denunciations on the right. The Republican National Committee accused Sanders of saying he wanted to \"abort poor babies for population control.\" Conservative CNN host S.E. Cupp accused Sanders of supporting \"EUGENICS.\" Fox News's headline alleged that Sanders said \"he'd back US funding for Third World abortions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can say three things:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many of these critiques distort what Sanders actually said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy Sanders said he would reverse is something each of the past two Democratic presidents have reversed, so his position on it is hardly a surprise. And \u2026</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders talked about the issue in a way Democrats haven't generally talked about it, which should raise some eyebrows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \"Mexico City agreement\" is also known as the \"Mexico City policy\" or the \"global gag rule.\" It prohibits U.S. foreign aid not just directly for abortions, but for any organization that provides abortion or abortion-related services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason its name includes the Mexican capital is that it was introduced there in 1984 at a global conference on the threat of population growth. The Reagan administration caused a stir by introducing the policy and de-emphasizing the threat of overpopulation at a time when much of the world was quite concerned about the issue \u2014 hence the global conference, the first of which had been held in 1974.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, the rule has been a political football, predictably being passed back and forth depending on which party wins the White House. Bill Clinton reversed it in the early days of his administration in 1993. George W. Bush reinstated it shortly after his inauguration in 2001. Then Barack Obama pulled it back in 2009. Then President Trump put it back in place in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason all this might be news to people is that population growth has generally moved to the back burner as a political issue \u2014 and it's not often invoked in the U.S. climate change debate. Sanders seems to think it should be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in 1984, population growth was generally talked about as an economic and political threat \u2014 and less so an environmental one. \"Rapid population growth that outstrips a nation's resources and its economy's ability to produce jobs serves as a breeding ground for civil and political unrest,\" the New York Times's editorial board wrote in opposition to Reagan's 1984 policy. Even Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, had at a 1974 global conference endorsed family planning for developing nations to combat population growth \"that makes economic development more difficult.\" (Weinberger was then in the Nixon administration.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The population growth debate has largely subsided because early projections of the amount of growth and the coinciding disasters never really panned out. Invoking this in the context of the climate change debate risks accusations of overhype and alarmism \u2014 which are already the chief arguments against immediate action on climate change. Plus, as reaction to Sanders's response showed, abortion foes see an inherent link between population-control efforts and an uptick in abortions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sanders is hardly the first Democrat to attach the issue to environmental concerns. In his 1992 book, soon-to-be Vice President Al Gore wrote, \"No goal is more crucial to healing the global environment than stabilizing human population.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Democrats have also been careful to separate abortion from population control \u2014 instead arguing the Mexico City policy would hurt other efforts besides abortion, by defunding organizations that provide a variety of services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amid a rift with the Vatican over his reversal of the policy, for example, Clinton in 1994 declared that \"the United States does not and will not support abortion as a means of birth control or population control.\" The line from the Obama administration was similar, given that Obama himself had campaigned on reducing abortions, even as he supported the right to one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's important to note that even reversing the Mexico City policy doesn't mean U.S. funds can go to funding abortions. Congress in 1974 banned the use of U.S. funds for abortion and abortion-related services, and that law remains on the books. The Mexico City policy simply expanded on that to prevent the funding of groups that provide such services \u2014 even if the money doesn't go directly to abortion services. It's similar to the debate over Planned Parenthood, which Republicans want to defund even though the federal funding it receives is already prohibited from being used for abortion services.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders's 2016 campaign said he opposes that 1974 law, known as the Helms amendment. So it's fair to say that he supports federal funding for foreign abortion services. (Hillary Clinton did, too.) But saying he supports that policy in order to \"abort poor babies for population control\" is taking things to another level. One can support federal funding for abortions domestically, for instance, without believing it should be used specifically to stop population growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sanders did invoke abortion in his answer, but only in accurately describing what the Mexico City policy does. He also nodded generally to the idea that American women \"have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions\" as a key principal. But when describing specifically how he would support combating global population growth, Sanders only mentioned birth control. People may infer things from the fact that he invoked \"reproductive decisions\" in his answer, but he never said he thinks the United States should support abortion as a means of population control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, he's wading into an issue that is dicey. Despite its origins, the Mexico City policy isn't generally talked about in the context of population control these days, nor is population control as frequent a climate change topic as Gore seemed to regard it in 1992. Sanders's answer certainly invites more debate on how much of a priority this is for the Democratic Party \u2014 and what specifically should be done about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This post has been updated to clarify Sanders's position on the Helms amendment.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

We know that it is more efficient to prioritize resilience now, rather than to keep rebuilding,\" the president said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As examples, he pointed to plans to build resilient, permanent housing communities in \"safe zones\" that families living in temporary bunkhouses will eventually move to. Similarly, infrastructure--such as roads and bridges--will be rebuilt \"to withstand the onslaught of disasters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said the next year would be focused on rebuilding infrastructure and constructing temporary housing, while the entire restoration effort will take up to four years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Aquino said the government would help fortify the agriculture and fishing industries in the central Philippines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coral reefs were damaged, as well as freshwater fish and oyster ponds, boats and jetties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Nov. 8 typhoon, which killed more than 6,000 people and left more than three million people homeless, hammered the midsection of the country with winds of around 150 miles an hour. About 101,000 people are still living in nearly 400 government shelters. The typhoon destroyed more than 550,000 homes across several regions in the central Philippines--an area mainly devoted to agriculture and accounting for 12.7% of gross domestic product. Government economic managers have said damage from the typhoon could lower growth, although reconstruction spending should temper the storm's effects on the economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday visited one of the hardest-hit cities, Tacloban, where the U.S. will provide an additional $24.6 million to ensure typhoon victims have clean water, food and temporary shelter. That is in addition to $62 million that the U.S. has already committed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is devastation that is unlike anything I've seen at this kind of scale,\" Mr. Kerry said. \"It's many tornadoes that I have seen in America wrapped into one.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kerry also said Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola, both U.S. companies, would help more than 2,000 small stores repair, restock and reopen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Aquino made another pitch to international donors to contribute to the nearly $8.2 billion the Philippines needs for short- and medium-term recovery and reconstruction. So far, the government said almost $520 million has been pledged in foreign aid for relief efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report said the biggest expense will be reconstruction of housing, at $4.15 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Infrastructure sectors--such as electricity, roads, bridges and public buildings--will need nearly $640 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Josephine Cuneta\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Plastics are also being dumped into our Great Lakes at the rate of 22 million tons each year. They infiltrate our lives through water, air and soil and have serious consequences for human and animal health in addition to choking our environment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Plastic, which is created from fossil fuels, also contributes to climate change at every step of its life cycle, from extraction to refinement, manufacture, transportation, disposal and waste. If plastic production and use grow as planned, by 2030 emissions from its production could reach 1.34 gigatons per year. That would be equivalent to the emissions released by some 295 new 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants. Plastics and climate change are a dual challenge to our well-being on our planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Help is on the way, but we as citizens must act. Congress has an opportunity to address the climate crisis and the plastic pollution crisis by passing the new Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2021, which builds on state laws across the country and outlines plastic reduction strategies that place the onus on the fossil fuel industry and plastic producers to realize a healthier and more sustainable future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Chicago Coalition for Plastic Reduction strongly urges our lawmakers in Washington to co-sponsor the pollution act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Jon Schmidt, Coalition for Plastic Reduction, Chicago</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bring US troops home</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since 2000, we have lost about 7,000 U.S. military members in Iraq and Afghanistan and have spent (directly and through budgetary obligations) $6.4 trillion on post-9/11 conflicts in areas of the world that do not like us, do not respect us and only want us to help prop up governments that can't stand on their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can stay there, and our opponents will slowly bleed us of personnel and dollars.

Small island states like the Maldives, facing an imminent threat from rising seas, want all countries to slash emissions as fast as possible. Oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia are not eager to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. And big developing countries like India are holding out for more help to shift to cleaner energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our team in Glasgow will be covering the talks live for the rest of the week. You can follow the Wednesday sessions here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The numbers: One of the main goals at the climate conference is a global pact to keep the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists say, the likelihood of deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and biodiversity collapse rises sharply. The planet has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trust, but verify: Satellites could be used to help determine whether nations are keeping their greenhouse gas pledges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A deal to phase out gasoline cars</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least six major automakers and more than two dozen national governments pledged on Wednesday to work toward phasing out sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 worldwide and by 2035 in \u201cleading markets.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The automakers who signed the pledge included Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Volvo. Together, they accounted for roughly one-quarter of global sales in 2019.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHaving these major players making these commitments, though we need to make sure that they follow through, is really significant,\u201d said Margo Oge, a former senior U.S. air quality official who now advises both environmental groups and auto companies. \u201cIt really tells us that these companies, and their boards, accept that the future is electric.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why it matters: Transportation accounts for roughly one-fifth of humanity\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions, with a little less than half of that coming from passenger vehicles like cars and vans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States did not join: Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said the Biden administration was \u201cfocused on what we are doing at home.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Looking to the future: Rivian, a maker of electric trucks and vans, is going public and has set a stock price that values the company at nearly $70 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Join us in Glasgow</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New York Times Climate Hub is still going strong on the sidelines of the U.N. climate conference.

Fewer than 10 were women. Their median age was over 60.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first week of the talks ended with boisterous protests of thousands on the streets of Glasgow. A march on Friday was led by young climate activists, most of them women and some barely old enough to vote in their countries. They accused the world leaders of wasting what little time remains to safeguard their future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those bookends to the first week of the talks revealed a widening divide that threatens to grow larger in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Video: More than 100,000 demonstrators marched in Glasgow, according to protest organizers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The numbers: Leaders at the summit are setting goals for 2030 at the earliest.

That\u2019s one of the big questions at COP26. A swift transition to renewable energy is crucial in the global fight against climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not only would that be particularly costly in poorer nations, many African countries have an abundance of natural gas or other fossil fuels.

Some scientists speculate solar activity may decline further in the coming decades. Could a quieting sun cause the climate to cool enough to stall or even reverse global warming from the build-up of greenhouse gases? Leading climate scientists say no, the effect of the sun is too small.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every 11-year solar cycle is different, exhibiting stronger or weaker peaks and valleys. These variations have implications for climate and weather which researchers are trying to better understand. The general thinking is that less sunspot activity imparts a slight cooling effect on the climate but with significant regional differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sinking number of sunspots (at the solar max) in recent decades has some solar scientists wondering: are we heading towards a state of solar quiescence not seen since the famed Maunder Minimum of the mid-1600s to the early 1700s? That historic low point in sunspot activity coincided with the heart of Little Ice Age which featured bitter cold winters in North America and Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Indeed, the sun could be on the threshold of a mini-Maunder event right now,\" NASA said last month. \"Ongoing Solar Cycle 24 is the weakest in more than 50 years. Moreover, there is (controversial) evidence of a long-term weakening trend in the magnetic field strength of sunspots.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Judith Lean, a climate and solar scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory, said if we're headed towards a Maunder Minimum-type event, its arrival is hardly imminent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I doubt that we are on the threshold of a Maunder Minimum event right now (as in, the next decade),\" Lean said in an email. \"The current modern maximum has indeed likely peaked, but the growth in activity from the Maunder Minimum (1634-1715) to the modern maximum (1976-1996) took a few centuries. So if solar activity is indeed in decline it will, I suppose, take a few centuries to reach a Maunder Minimum type event.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lean stressed forecasts of the sun's activity are fraught with uncertainty and in their infancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't know what the sun will do - no one does because forecasting future solar activity even one solar cycle ahead is not at all reliable,\" Lean said. \"You may recall that initial forecasts for solar cycle 24 (our current cycle) were that it would be stronger than cycle 23 (which peaked around 2000-2002) whereas we are now probably near the peak of cycle 24 and it is very modest - weaker than 3 prior cycles.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's assume solar activity does drop in the coming decades. What might that mean for climate?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Mann, professor of climate science at Penn State University, said the effect of the 11-year solar cycle on climate is small.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Studies that have looked at the longer-term impact of a potential 21st century grand solar minimum have found that the [temperature] response would be dwarfed by anthropogenic [manmade] warming [from the build-up of greenhouse gas concentrations],\" Mann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, a recent study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters (Feulner and Rahmstorf, 2010) concluded a minimum in solar activity would shave just 0.3 degrees C off projected warming by 2100.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For her part, Lean agreed with the results of this study and with Mann.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Given our current understanding of how the sun varies and how climate responds, were the sun to enter a new Maunder Minimum, it would not mean a new Little Ice Age - it would simply slow down the current warming by a modest amount,\" Lean said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While these scientists see just a minor impact on the average global temperature from a possible solar minimum, the effects on regional climate may be more profound, though incompletely understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A recent report from the National Research Council (NRC) \"The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate\" finds small variations in solar output can have \"major influence\" on climate, particularly at the regional scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an example of the sun's possible effects on regional climate, consider the 2011 study in Nature Geoscience \"Solar forcing of winter climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere\" which found low solar activity is associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A negative NAO often results in cold, snowy conditions in eastern North American and northern Europe in winter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related: Has the sun driven recent precipitation extremes in Northeast?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists say more research is needed to understand the possible effects of the sun's evolving behavior on climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the sun really is entering an unfamiliar phase of the solar cycle, then we must redouble our efforts to understand the sun-climate link,\" said Lika Guhathakurta of NASA's Living with a Star Program, which helped fund the NRC study.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

But is it possible?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To slow extinctions and climate change, President-elect Joe Biden has embraced a plan to conserve 30 percent of U.S. land and 30 percent of its ocean waters by 2030. It is perhaps the most ambitious commitment to conservation by a U.S. president. How he proceeds will determine whether he unites or further divides Americans in a pivotal decade for the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plan is known as \u201c30 by 30.\u201d Behind the catchy phrase is a simple, scientifically informed belief that conserving 30 percent of the planet\u2019s land and 30 percent of its water is required to protect roughly 75 percent of Earth\u2019s species and slow climate change by storing carbon in plants and soil. In the words of a former interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, 30 by 30 is \u201ca kind of synthesizing, consolidating, organizing possibility.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twenty-six percent of U.S. ocean waters are now protected consistent with the goals of 30 by 30, but only 12 percent of the land. The goal of conserving 18 percent more of the land within this decade means protecting an area more than twice the size of Texas. It is an enormous challenge and requires carefully assembling a patchwork of not only public but also private land. Still, there are ways to do it that can draw different interests together toward a common goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many difficult questions must now be answered: Which places should we conserve? What do we count as \u201cconserved?\u201d How do we conserve it? And who decides?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The quickest path for the United States to reach its 30 percent land goal would rely on Mr. Biden\u2019s executive powers to increase the protection of federal lands by designating new national monuments and banning drilling, mining and timber harvesting. But most of the country\u2019s biodiversity and potential to store carbon are not on federal lands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About two-thirds of species on the Endangered Species List exist mainly on private land. More than half of the country\u2019s forests \u2014 critical carbon sinks, places that absorb more carbon dioxide than they release \u2014 are privately owned. Private lands also connect our public lands, providing seasonal habitat for wide-ranging wildlife and clean drinking water, crop pollination and flood control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Top-down declarations and land-use restrictions from Washington risk alienating rural Americans who otherwise support healthy lands, waters and wildlife. Instead of taking shortcuts to protect federal lands in ways that could antagonize nearby communities, the administration should work with state, local and tribal governments and the private sector to build on proven models of landscape conservation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, protecting land meant setting it aside as wilderness. But scientists increasingly view this approach alone as too narrow and rigid. Indigenous scholars have shown that many areas we now call wilderness were shaped over thousands of years by human activities. And the science on how ecosystems respond to climate change shows that they will move, shrink and grow. Modern conservation strategies avoid isolating ecosystems within hard boundaries and instead seek to connect tracts of land with diverse histories of protection and ownership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ideally, existing or newly protected public lands can link to surrounding private lands. One important tool is the conservation easement, a legal contract that allows for tax breaks or payments to landowners who give up development rights. But forgoing development forever is too great a commitment for many landowners. Other tools include some federal agricultural programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Program, which pay landowners annually to set aside sensitive habitats. The problem is that these incentives provide little long-term security against development.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Achieving 30 by 30 on private lands will require the durability of easements and the flexibility of short-term incentive programs. One such approach could be conservation leases with terms of 20 to 30 years that are palatable to landowners while providing meaningful protection. These programs would be less expensive than land purchases or easements, providing new ways for corporations and philanthropists to underwrite land protection at a scale much greater than can be achieved through the outright purchase of land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Biden administration can find many useful models of large landscape conservation encompassing both public and private lands. In the East, America\u2019s Longleaf Initiative, a coalition of government agencies, nonprofits and corporate and family forest owners, is restoring the longleaf pine ecosystem that once extended from Texas to Florida and north to Virginia. Since 2007 this work has driven an extraordinary recovery of the longleaf pine ecosystem to 4.7 million acres from 3.4 million acres.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the West, the Agriculture Department\u2019s Sage Grouse Initiative has secured easements on nearly 700,000 acres of private land across 11 Western states \u2014 including areas of Wyoming and Montana that are part of the world\u2019s longest-known mule deer and pronghorn migrations. This initiative has increased sage grouse nesting and foraging habitat on a further seven million acres by working with ranchers to restore grasslands, streams and wetlands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans generally support land conservation, but differ over how it should be carried out. A survey published this year by Duke University suggests that while rural Americans care deeply about conservation, they do not trust big environmental groups like those that have pushed 30 by 30. Instead, they prefer policies overseen by state and local governments that foster collaboration with communities. A failure to engage rural Americans is the fastest way to ensure collapse of 30 by 30.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration must also recognize the violence, displacement and marginalization that have often accompanied land conservation. Native Americans and other peoples of color have been largely excluded from U.S. conservation policy, and many of them, living in cities, view public lands as remote and unwelcoming. A successful 30 by 30 strategy must encompass needs as diverse as tribal priorities and urban green spaces in historically excluded communities. Mr. Biden signaled a commitment to environmental justice last week when he said he would nominate Deb Haaland, a congressional representative from New Mexico and a Native American, to lead the Interior Department, which manages more than 440 million acres of federal land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where does the Biden White House begin? The administration should move quickly to develop a science-based plan and lay out an inclusive process. At the same time, the sheer scale of the vision will require taking the time to coordinate across the entire federal government and with state, local and tribal governments. With careful planning, the Biden administration can ensure that 30 by 30 doesn\u2019t die as a fleeting national aspiration, but sets the course for a truly inclusive conservation vision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arthur Middleton and Justin Brashares are professors in the department of environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Unnerved and fearful? Something big and bad and existential seems like it's coming down the pike and you can't quite put your finger on it?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse yet, feeling a little bit ... complicit?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does the Chicago Public Library have a book for you.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 2019 selection for its One Book, One Chicago cross-city reading initiative is the tremendous (and tremendously scary) \"The Sixth Extinction\" (Henry Holt 2014), New Yorker staff writer Elizabeth Kolbert's 2014 tour de force history about mass species die-offs and the overwhelming evidence that we are currently living through such a period of steep, probably irreversible decline. She visits the last stand for frogs in South America and the caves in Vermont that are littered with the bodies of bats succumbing to a mysterious disease. As the Tribune review said at the time: \"It's not exactly a whodunit.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We shuttle invasive species around the globe and lean on fossil fuels.Last week, the Trump administration announced an end to energy-saving light-bulb initiatives, and just before that, the dismantling of the Endangered Species Act. On the surface of Lake Michigan, record water levels are swamping beaches and concrete walls; beneath the water, invasive mussels carpet the lake. Insects are going extinct faster than we can keep up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CPL, as it has for all its One Book, One Chicago selections for the past 18 years, is planning related events from October through February -- including an excellent-sounding speaker series with Dan Egan (\"The Death and Life of the Great Lakes\"), David Wallace-Wells (\"The Uninhabitable Earth\") and Kolbert herself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But frankly, read \"The Sixth Extinction\" and you wonder if there'll be a fall -- or a winter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a statement about the new book selection, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said, \"Climate change is not only a fact, it is among the most urgent and dire global crises we face. Through studying this important subject, we will not only help educate our young readers of this reality, but also inspire them to do something about it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only Kolbert felt that way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From her home in the Berkshires (where she is working on another environmental book), Kolbert said that Chicago is not the first city to choose \"The Sixth Extinction\" for its all-city reading initiative, but it is the largest. She also said that, in the five years since the book was released, \"to be as objective as possible, some things (discussed in the book) are irreversible -- if you're extinct, it's hard to change that -- and some things will be harder to fix now. We will be leaving our kids with a seriously different planet and some of that trajectory we can't alter. Some say 'Don't give up!' and some want to say 'Give up,' but the truth is that neither of (those views) feels entirely accurate or realistic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked if the speed of environmental change (and lack of coherent government policy) has rendered the book outdated since publication, she said no, that \"if anything it's been born out by the events of the last five years. Every day you click on a story or open the paper and find more evidence that something serious is happening.

Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cIf the question is, \u2018Could this move us along the path we want to be on?\u2019 the answer is yes, it could.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his speech, Mr. Obama said he would use executive powers to limit the carbon dioxide that power plants could emit. He also called for government spending to promote the development of energy alternatives, and committed to helping cities and states protect themselves from rising seas and other effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But formally, the main thing he did on Tuesday was order the Environmental Protection Agency to devise an emissions control plan, with the first draft due in a year. Experts say he will be lucky to get a final plan in place by the time he leaves office in early 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama is trying to ensure continuation of a trend already under way: emissions in the United States have been falling for several years. But at the global scale, they are rising fast, and as the president acknowledged, it will take much stronger international action to turn that around and head off the worst effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cFor the world at large, the United States is just one piece of the puzzle,\u201d Mr. Levi said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, glaciers are melting, heat waves and heavy rains are increasing, the food system is under stress and the sea is rising. The best that can be hoped for, scientists say, is to limit the damage, or slow it enough to provide society more time to adjust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president recognized that in his plan, calling for more steps to help the country prepare, from strengthening sea walls to hardening the electrical grid.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, however, is lowering the country\u2019s emissions using administrative remedies, an effort to sidestep a recalcitrant Congress. The success of that goal will depend on how far the administration is able to stretch the boundaries of the Clean Air Act, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court has already ruled that it can be used to regulate greenhouse gases, which include carbon dioxide emissions, but figuring out how to do that within the technical requirements of the law will be a major challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s thinking appears to have been influenced by a proposal from an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The group urged a creative approach, calling on the federal government to set a target level of greenhouse gases for each state, taking account of historical patterns. A state generating a lot of power from coal, then exporting it to other states, would not be unduly penalized, for instance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the environmental group envisions it, states would meet their goals by tweaking the overall electrical system, not just by cracking down on individual power plants. States might urge companies to produce more renewable power, for instance, but they could also retrofit homes and businesses to reduce energy waste, or encourage the use of clean-burning natural gas instead of coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States would presumably be allowed to use market signals, like a price on greenhouse emissions, to achieve their goals, as California and nine Northeastern states are already doing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is unclear how much all this might cost at the retail level. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that even if prices go up, electric bills for many consumers could actually decline as their homes were retrofitted to use less energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fossil-fuel industry and its allies in Congress are certain to argue that the president\u2019s plan will be ruinously expensive and require the shutdown of numerous coal-burning power plants. Republican leaders immediately condemned the plan as a job-killer and framed it as an attack on coal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The political attraction of a state-led approach is that it would move a lot of the nitty-gritty decision making out of Washington. But, for that very reason, it would entail legal risk. The Clean Air Act, written in the heyday of environmentalism, basically envisions commandments from Washington ordering utilities to clean up the air, not flexible approaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere reached a historic level of 400 parts per million last month, emissions from the United States have been falling, partly because of the weak economy but also because of the newfound abundance of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing. Gas has displaced a lot of coal in power generation; such switching cuts greenhouse emissions nearly in half for a given amount of electricity produced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other factors, like tougher building codes, are contributing to the decline. And transport emissions are falling in part because of one of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies: tough fuel-efficiency measures for new cars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But modest reductions already achieved in the United States and other Western countries are being swamped by rising emissions from the East. So the real question is whether technologies can be developed, and then deployed worldwide, that allow for continued economic growth and rising energy use with minimal greenhouse emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his speech, Mr. Obama sought to reclaim global leadership on climate change for the United States. His plan includes ideas and money for making global progress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel P. Schrag, head of Harvard\u2019s Center for the Environment, said the president\u2019s plan would succeed only if it created market conditions unleashing the creative power of American capitalism, calling forth greater innovation in the energy industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama nodded to that point in his speech, noting that \u201ccountries like China and Germany are going all in\u201d on the clean energy race. \u201cI believe Americans build things better than anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cI want America to win that race, but we can\u2019t win it if we\u2019re not in it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John M.

And that's assuming politicians find the most efficient ways to reduce carbon emissions. \"If not, the real cost could double.\" Mr. Lomborg says that  at best the cuts \"will prevent a total temperature rise by 2100 of only 0.306 degrees Fahrenheit  .\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He adds  , \"The U.N.'s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, says openly that the aim of the talks is 'to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution.'\" But that model has worked pretty well  . \"For one, life expectancy in the past 150 years has more than doubled, to 71 years in 2013 from fewer than 30 years in 1870.\" Meanwhile, those living in extreme poverty now comprise less than 10% of the world's population, down from more than 75%   a century and a half ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our columnist Bret Stephens describes   the obscure Belgian town of Molenbeek that has become a breeding ground for Islamic terrorists, including at least one of the Paris attackers. \"For many years the mayor of Molenbeek was a man named Philippe Moureaux, a Socialist best known as the author of the 1981 Law Against Racism and Xenophobia. In 2004 he helped pass a law allowing noncitizens to vote in municipal elections. Roughly a quarter of Molenbeek's 96,000 residents are not Belgian citizens. Mr. Moureaux was also instrumental in engineering the political marriage of his Socialist Party with Muslim arrivals from Turkey and North Africa,\" writes Mr. Stephens  .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For college administrators struggling to respond to student protests, our columnist William McGurn suggests   a 1960s example of campus leadership. Notre Dame's Rev. Theodore Hesburgh \"recognized 'the validity of protest' but made clear that any group that 'substituted force for rational persuasion, be it violent or nonviolent,' would be given 15 minutes to meditate. Students who persisted would have their IDs confiscated and be 'suspended from this community.'\" Said Hesburgh,   \"I would like to insist here that all of us are responsible to the duly constituted laws of this University community and to all of the laws of the land. There is no other guarantee of civilization  versus the jungle or mob rule, here or elsewhere.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama is criticizing Americans who oppose accepting refugees from Syria. \"If Mr. Obama fought Islamic State with half the vigor with which he delivers moral lectures, he'd find that a much less fearful America would welcome far more refugees,\"says a Journal editorial  . Mr. Obama is \"especially harsh on those, like Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, who say Christian refugees should be a priority,\" writes the editorial board  . \"But Messrs. Bush and Cruz are right that Christians are under particular threat from Islamic State. If they aren't killed for jihadist sport, they must convert to Islam or die. Their daughters are raped and forced into Muslim marriages. Their churches are blown up. The U.S. would have been right to accept and save more Jews from Nazi genocide in the 1930s and 1940s. Syrian Christians are no different today  .\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A separate Journal editorial says   that in response to a question on ISIS at Saturday night's debate, Hillary Clinton's \"free association could not have been more substance-free  .\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editorial board also observes   that \"Japan is in recession for the fifth time in seven years, and the second time since Shinzo Abe returned to office three years ago.\" Mr. Abe has favored increased government spending and monetary expansion. \"The result is a national debt set to hit 250% of GDP by the end of the year. The Bank of Japan is buying bonds at a $652 billion annual rate, a more radical quantitative easing than the Federal Reserve's. Yet deflation continues because banks haven't increased lending.\" And needed deregulation hasn't occurred.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But quantitative easing in the U.S. has been radical enough to drive changes in the way Americans save for retirement. Michael Thompson of S&P Investment Advisory Services notes   that a \"recent report from Fidelity Investments found that 11% of its 401(k) account holders aged 50-54 had a staggering 100% of their retirement assets invested in stocks.\" But \"with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields averaging 2.3% over the past five years, retirement-age investors have had few alternatives.\" As a result, says Mr. Thompson,   his firm estimates \"roughly $1.3 trillion in retiree assets are currently misallocated into equities based on the historic 16-year average price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By James Freeman\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Researchers found a 27-fold increase over the past decade in the number of people experiencing an \u201cextreme smoke day,\u201d which is defined as air quality deemed unhealthy for all age groups. In 2020 alone, nearly 25 million people across the contiguous United States were affected by dangerous smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the growing threats posed by fire have been explored in detail, particularly for populations in the most fire-prone regions, the risks that smoke pollution pose have been stymied by lack of precise data until now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cPeople may be less likely to notice days with a modest increase in fine particulate matter from smoke, but those days can still have an impact on people\u2019s health,\u201d said Marissa Childs, who led the research while getting her Ph.D from Stanford. She also noted that the most extreme smoke days were rarely seen between 2006 to 2010. But in the more recent study years, from 2016 to 2020, she said the research shows that more than 1.5 million people, particularly in the Western United States, were routinely exposed to levels that carry immediate risks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Childs, currently a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Center for the Environment and School of Public Health, had originally intended to focus on the health effects of fire-related air pollution. \u201cWhen we started, we realized there were a lot of questions about how smoke affected people\u2019s health that we didn\u2019t have answers to,\u201d she said, including basic questions around estimated mortality from smoke fine particulate matter, and how the health effects of smoke compare with other sources of pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Filling in that gap was a long and arduous process. The analysis began with satellite data to map the geographic spread of particulate matter from above, and incorporated ground-level monitors to measure pollution where it matters most to human health. The research isolated wildfire smoke from background pollution from other sources, which has actually decreased in recent decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe have been remarkably successful in cleaning up other sources of air pollution across the country, mainly due to regulation like the Clean Air Act,\u201d said Marshall Burke, a co-author of the research and professor of earth system science at Stanford. \u201cThat success, especially in the West, has really stagnated. And in recent years this started to reverse.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The research indicates that wildfire smoke is a leading cause of that reversal, wiping out most of the progress. Some areas in the Western United States had increases in particulate pollution from smoke that were about the same amount as the improvements in air quality from regulating factories and other point-source pollution. As climate change intensifies fire risk across the country and smoke plumes can travel thousands of miles from their source, no one is safe from the effects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Particulate pollution causes more than short-term irritation. It has been linked to chronic heart and lung conditions, as well other negative health effects like cognitive decline, depression and premature birth. But more work remains to be done on pollution specifically from wildfires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is no safe concentration,\u201d said Tarik Benmarhnia, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego, who contributed to an earlier study on hospitalizations showing that smoke from wildfires can be 10 times more harmful than other sources of air pollution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, much of the existing research sees wildfires as something \u201crare, exceptional and intense,\u201d according to Dr. Benmarhnia. But in a changing climate, he sees the health impacts of chronic exposure as one of the biggest questions to answer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Subsequent research with this data will have important policy implications, both for local governments at the source of wildfires and for wider populations affected by smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One solution, experts say, is to reduce the potential for wildfires to grow into long-lasting and destructive infernos. In recent years, California has recognized that decades of fire suppression have led to a build-up of fuel in forests where smaller, contained fires actually contribute to the health of the forest. The state has been increasing prescribed fires and other forest management techniques to help reduce the risk of out-of-control megafires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new research indicates that the health risk is rising as the hot and dry conditions for wildfires continue to worsen with climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And existing warning systems won\u2019t be enough in the future. \u201cWe can\u2019t just ask people to stay inside half the year,\u201d said Dr. Benmarhnia. \u201cAt the end of the day, the best type of policy is to proactively prevent these big fires in the first place.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Just when you thought you couldn't take any more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finding out that 1 million species face extinction without radical corrective changes in human behavior is akin to finding out you have a fatal disease. One day you have a thousand problems; the next, you have just one. Nothing in today's headlines compares to the catastrophic potential posed by climate change and the decimating effects of careless consumerism around the globe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The four horsemen of the apocalypse \u2014 generally considered to be conquest, war, famine and death \u2014 weren't far off the mark. Today, we might revise the New Testament version to include plastics, emissions, deforestation and Homo sapiens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lest some folks become incensed by this apparent disparagement of man's great works (see war and conquest), be assured that such evidence is everywhere abundant and noted. But men and women who can create plastic (my own great-uncle, a chemist, played a part) can surely find biodegradable \u2014 and profitable \u2014 alternatives. Dustin Hoffman may not don flippers and scuba gear to unwillingly celebrate the future of plastics, as famously portrayed in \"The Graduate,\" but perhaps a young congresswoman from the Bronx will lead a confetti parade driving a cardboard convertible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's time to change our habits and, pending a better cliche, save the planet. It's dying, and we'll die with it, eventually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report, a summary of which was released Monday by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), was the result of a three-year study by 145 authors from 50 countries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robert Watson, a British chemist who served as chair of the panel, wrote in a statement that \"the health of ecosystems on which we and all species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, Watson also said, it's not too late to repair and sustain nature \u2014 if we act now in transformative ways. It won't be enough for us to recycle our Dasani bottles or tote our own shopping bags, though these are helpful and keep us mindful. But big companies have to sign on, and governments have to create incentives and policies to advance sweeping change. Needless to say, this won't be easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In certain quarters, resistance to policy and procedures will be seized upon as a noble counter to regulatory zeal. Already, some so-called \nconservatives\nare gearing up to treat the report as a globalist attempt to hinder the United States' return to greatness via more burning of fossil fuels, drilling for oil offshore and declassifying conservation areas. But conservatives by definition should lead the imperative. To conserve what is good \u2014 isn't that the point?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The report makes the essential connection to human wellness, as opposed to merely caring about the horrors endured by sea creatures dying with their stomachs packed with plastic or Arctic animals starving to death as the ground melts beneath their feet. If something hurts economies and schoolchildren, we eventually get around to paying attention. As Watson \nnoted, \"We need to link it to human well-being; that's the crucial thing. Otherwise we're going to look like a bunch of tree-huggers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only there were enough trees to go around.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's clear is that there's no time for delay or partisan bickering. What's different now is the degree of acceleration. Everything is speeding up, including the temperature and acidification of oceans, which contribute to the loss of coral reefs, themselves underwater ecosystems essential to more than 25 percent of marine species.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the world's population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by mid-century, according to the United Nations. Already, it has tripled since 1950. Collectively, we humans have altered 75 percent of Earth's land and more than half of the marine environment. More people require more crops, more land  and fewer trees, which ultimately results in warmer temperatures \u2014 and you know the rest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Who knows?

Are you surprised the margin wasn\u2019t wider given that Cuccinelli had expressed wildly right-wing views on issues ranging from climate change to abortion, leading to a campaign that forced voters to mull their views on global warming, sodomy and transvaginal ultrasounds?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or are you amazed that the Democrats won this one at all, with a candidate who admitted \u2014 practically bragged \u2014 that while driving his newborn son home from the hospital, he stopped to make a 15-minute appearance at a political fund-raiser while infant and weeping wife sat in the car?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI felt bad for Dorothy, but it was a million bucks for the Democratic Party,\u201d McAuliffe said in his autobiography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honestly, it was a miracle anybody in Virginia showed up to vote. I did like Cuccinelli\u2019s breakout attack theme: \u201cAll puppy and no plan.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that one resurfaces during the presidential race. Which is just around the corner, presuming the corner lasts for 26 months.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential! That brings us back to Chris Christie, the man of the hour. Even though he\u2019s a Republican in a deep blue state, he won a huge victory against \u2014 um, the Democrat. Who was ... named ... Barbara Buono.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Buono was battling odds that made the Alamo look like a quick game of Parcheesi. She\u2019s a 20-year veteran of the State Legislature, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that always inspires excitement among the electorate. She had about a quarter of Christie\u2019s budget for ads. Nobody from the Clinton family went to New Jersey to campaign for her. Some days, it seemed as if nobody from New Jersey was showing up, either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe Democratic political bosses ... made a deal with this governor, despite him representing almost everything they\u2019re against. They didn\u2019t do it for the state. They did it to help themselves politically and financially,\u201d Buono said on election night, in a speech that centered on the terribleness of her own state party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a place that\u2019s dominated by one political party, like New Jersey, the electorate often picks somebody from the other side to be governor, in hopes that he or she will keep a lid on things. Christie is sort of a larger and louder version of New York\u2019s George Pataki, who I believe has been in New Hampshire trying to drum up presidential primary interest since 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Christie sees himself as a scrappy guy fighting against impossible odds, but he\u2019s actually been wildly lucky. Politically, he\u2019s in a perfect position. To his left, the New Jersey State Legislature and the county bosses. To his right, the crazy national Republican Party. He gets everything in between!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe people of New Jersey rewarded me last night for the personal relationship that we have,\u201d he told a press conference on Wednesday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Christie has been suggesting, very, very frequently, that his success is all about personality. That certainly makes sense, since his major actual achievement as governor was to get everyone to agree on a plan to bail out the public employee pension fund ... soon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is he the tough-talking truth-teller the nation is yearning for? Critics in New Jersey say the governor\u2019s main administrative talent is for balancing a budget with imaginary revenues. But even if Christie was really the candidate he claims to be, we\u2019re not the electorate we imagine we are. Who was the last person to get to the White House without a public persona that was smooth and affable? Richard Nixon? Harry Truman? I hear John Adams was kind of prickly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Could Christie survive a presidential race when he couldn\u2019t even get past the Mitt Romney vice presidential vetting process? There\u2019s all that stuff about exploding expense accounts and his prior career as a lobbyist for the securities industry. True, the people of New Jersey have looked into his past and come away satisfied. But, really, in New Jersey you\u2019re just happy to know a candidate is not currently under indictment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have so much to discuss. Thank God we\u2019ve got 790 more days until the Iowa caucuses.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

Many take direct aim at the decisions of former President Donald Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden also spoke with foreign leaders like Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to reinstate a relationship between the two countries and speak on shared challenges like tackling climate change and the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here are some actions Biden took during his first week as president of the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s latest executive orders</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prioritizing climate change and the environmental policy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden signed a series of executive orders Wednesday to combat climate change. The three orders focus on an array of climate and environmental justice-related measures such as focusing on infrastructure needs and prioritizing scientific research.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The orders elevate climate change as a national security concern and paves the way for the re-establishment of the president\u2019s council of advisors of science and technology.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More: Poll: Americans want Congress to cooperate with Biden, view his agenda positively</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, Biden also signed an order to halt construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is set to pass through the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana and the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The administration also suspended new drilling permits on federal land and waters for 60 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his first day in office, Biden also had the United States rejoin the Paris Agreement, an international treaty focused on climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and other environment-related policy, reversing Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the agreement in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans have denounced Biden\u2019s policies, saying his climate policies are too expensive and can eliminate oil and gas jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, Biden launched the $700 billion Buy American campaign, which encourages the federal government to buy more American-made products.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This effort, which the president states \u201cwill help American businesses compete in strategic industries and help America\u2019s workers thrive\u201d, also calls on the director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish a Made in America office and appoint a made in America director who will head the office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration argues that this effort will further stimulate the U.S. economy, which has struggled during the pandemic. The unemployment rate in the U.S. was 6.7% in December and employers cut about 140,000 jobs, according to the Department of Labor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, Biden also laid out the foundation to raise the minimum wage to $15 and restored collective bargaining power and worker protections for federal workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt is the policy of the United States to protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce \u2026 The Federal Government should serve as a model employer,\u201d the executive order states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another executive order calls on federal agencies and departments to \u201cprioritize actions that provide the greatest relief to individuals, families, and small businesses; and to State, local, tribal, and territorial governments.\u201d Biden specifically asks federal agencies to improve accessibility or reduce unnecessary barriers to programs that can help struggling Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During his first day on the job, the president also signed an executive order to extend the nationwide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures until March 31. Additionally, Biden extended the pause on student federal loan payments and interest to Sept. 30.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration reform</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after his victory, the president promised Americans he would work to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s strict policies on immigration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden issued several immigration-related executive orders on day one. He reinstated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era program that shielded undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump reversed the program in 2017, sending it through layers of litigation. Biden also sent his immigration reform plan to Congress, which outlines a path to permanent residence and citizenship for DACA beneficiaries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's proposal was met with clear opposition from several GOP members of Congress like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McConnell called the plan \"a massive proposal for blanket amnesty that would gut enforcement of American laws while creating huge new incentives for people to rush here illegally at the same time,\" according to NBC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undocumented immigrants will now also be counted as a part of the U.S. census, which takes place every 10 years, per another executive order. Biden also revoked an executive order issued by Trump in 2017 that cracked down on communities shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cImmigrants have helped strengthen America\u2019s families, communities, businesses and workforce, and economy, infusing the United States with creativity, energy, and ingenuity,\u201d the president wrote in the executive order.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to targeting policies related to undocumented immigrants, Biden reversed Trump\u2019s policy that forbid refugees and residents from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. The order also states the Secretary of State must resume visa processing within the next 45 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden also terminated the construction of the widely controversial border wall at the U.S.-Mexico southern border and will direct a review of the resources and funds that were redirected to build the wall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Promoting equity and diversity</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden tackled the issues of housing discrimination and equity on Tuesday after issuing executive orders directing his administration to address racial bias in housing programs and terminate the government\u2019s use of private prisons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also recently reversed Trump\u2019s transgender ban in the military with an executive order stating all Americans, regardless of gender identity, can serve in the military. Similarly, Biden also extended federal nondiscrimination protections to members of the LGBTQ+ community</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cEvery person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love,\u201d Biden wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COVID-19 safety measures</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Upon assuming office, Biden began to roll out several COVID-19 safety measures and policy proposals. To date, the United States has seen over 400,000 deaths related to the coronavirus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden\u2019s first measure as president was asking Americans to wear a mask for the first 100 days of his presidency as a part of the \u201c100 Days Masking Challenge.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden also issued an executive order requiring masks and social distancing in all federal buildings and on federal lands. Federal employees and contractors are also required to wear masks. The order also calls on the Department of Health and Human Services and the Center for Disease Control to work with state, local, tribal and territorial leaders to implement requirements for masking, social distancing and other safety measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Additionally, Biden issued another executive order requiring masks on several modes of transportation, including planes, trains, busses and ferries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also reversed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. The administration also vowed to work with WHO on \u201cCOVID-19 health and humanitarian response, and advance global health and health security.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A day after his assuming office, Biden issued an order calling for the improvement and expansion of access to healthcare and COVID-19 vaccines. To support the development of more treatments, the president is asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the director of the National Institutes of Health to craft a plan to support vaccine studies and research in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another order, Biden called on the heads of all executive departments and agencies to gather, share and publish data on the virus. The president also extended federal support to governors using the National Guard to respond to the impacts of the pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the pandemic continues to disrupt the academic and professional lives of thousands of Americans, the president issued two executive orders to ease the transition from online to in-person learning and enforcing the protection of essential workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first order, which states the president\u2019s support for re-opening schools, calls on the Secretary of Education to work with elementary and secondary schools on how to reopen and stay open. The order came as counties across the U.S. are debating reopening schools and the possible implications of doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Undoing Trump's policies and other things Biden did his first week as president\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 2}

For the region, this period is now the driest two decades in 1,200 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crisis is particularly acute in Monterrey, one of Mexico's most important economic hubs and where the entire metropolitan area of about 5 million people is affected by drought, according to officials. Some neighborhoods in Monterrey have been without water for 75 days, leading many schools to close before the scheduled summer break.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The situation in the city has gotten so dire, a visiting journalist could not find any drinking water for sale at several stores, including a Walmart.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Buckets, too, are scarce at local stores -- or being sold at astronomically high prices -- as Monterrey's residents scrape together containers to collect water supplied by government trucks sent to the driest neighborhoods. Some residents clean out trash cans to ferry water home, children struggling to help carry what can amount to 450 pounds of water.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monterrey is in northern Mexico, the most parched region of the country, which has seen its population grow in recent years as the economy boomed. But the area's typically arid weather is struggling to support the population as climate change reduces what little rainfall the region has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monterrey's residents can now walk across the floor of the reservoir that was created by the Cerro Prieto Dam and was once one of the city's largest sources of water. The reservoir also used to be a major tourist attraction that the local government marketed for its lively waterfront restaurants and its fishing, boating and water-skiing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The amount of rain in July in parts of the state of Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas and whose capital is Monterrey, was just 10% of the monthly average recorded since 1960, according to Juan Ignacio Barragan Villarreal, the general director of the city's water agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In March it did not rain a single drop in the entire state,'' he said, adding that it was the first rain-free March since the government started keeping records in 1960.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now the government distributes about 2.38 million gallons of water daily to 400 neighborhoods. Every day large trucks filled with water and pipes for distribution fan out across Monterrey and its suburbs to tend to the needs of the driest neighborhoods, often illegal settlements that are home to the poorest residents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alejandro Casas, a water truck driver, said that when he started the job five years ago, he supported the city's firefighters and was called perhaps once or twice a month to deliver water to a fire scene.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he now works every day, making up to 10 daily trips to various neighborhoods to supply about 200 families with each trip.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time Casas arrives, a long queue snakes through neighborhood streets with people waiting their turn. Some families carry containers that can hold 53 gallons, and wait throughout the afternoon before finally receiving water at midnight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The water he delivers can be all the family gets for up to a week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one polices the lines, so fights break out as residents from other communities try to sneak in instead of waiting for trucks to reach their neighborhood days later.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May, Casas' truck was stormed by several young men who threatened him as he was delivering water to one neighborhood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"They spoke to me with a very threatening tone,\" Casas said, explaining that they demanded he drive the truck to their neighborhood to distribute water. \"They told me that if we don't go to where they wanted, they were going to kidnap us.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Casas headed to the other neighborhood, filled residents' buckets and was set free.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maria De Los Angeles, 45, was born and raised in Cienega de Flores, a town near Monterrey. She says the water crisis is straining her family and her business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have never experienced a crisis like this before,\" De Los Angeles said. \"The water only comes through our taps every four or five days.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crisis, she said, is pushing her into bankruptcy -- a garden nursery she owns is her family's only source of livelihood and needs more water than can be provided by the occasional water that flows through her home's taps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have to buy a water tank every week that costs me 1,200 pesos,\" equal to $60, from a private supplier, she said. That consumes about half of her weekly income of $120.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Small-business owners like De Los Angeles are frustrated that they are left to fend for themselves while Monterrey's big industries are largely able to operate normally because of federal concessions that give them special access to the city's aquifers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To try to mitigate future shortages, the state is investing about $97 million to build a plant to treat wastewater and plans to buy water from a desalination plant under construction in a neighboring state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government has spent about $82 million to rent more trucks to distribute water, pay additional drivers and dig more wells, according to Barragan Villarreal, the general director of the water agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The governor of Nuevo Leon state, Samuel Garcia, recently urged the world to act together to tackle climate change because it was beyond the capacity of any single government to confront.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The climate crisis has caught up to us,\" Garcia wrote on Twitter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Today we have to take care of the environment, it is life or death.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAPTION: Photo: Residents line up to fill their containers with water on  June 21 in Monterrey, the second largest city in Mexico.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) laid out to voters here how she helped get $4 billion in the bill to combat the acute drought now punishing the American West. Outside the air-conditioned offices of the Las Vegas Valley Water District where she spoke, the temperature stood at 93 degrees \u2014 on its way to an oppressive 106 later that day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As you all know, the western U.S. continues to face a historic drought, and we need to do all we can to combat it,\" Cortez Masto said Monday, standing before a photo showing the nation's largest reservoir, Lake Mead, at record lows. \"That's why I have been championing measures to help Southern Nevada further conserve, recycle and reduce water use.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto \u2014 one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for reelection this year \u2014 has spent recent weeks courting Nevada voters who want leaders in Washington to prioritize the climate crisis. Yet climate change has rarely decided the outcome in congressional races, even in Las Vegas, the nation's second-fastest warming city in a region experiencing the most extreme drought in 1,200 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters across the country have consistently ranked the economy and health care as a higher priority than global warming. And if Democrats cannot successfully sell their environmental agenda in Nevada, which has seen a cascade of climate disasters this summer, it's unclear whether climate concerns will ever become paramount in key national races.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In interviews with more than a dozen voters in the working-class neighborhoods that encircle Las Vegas, most said they were focused on providing for their families amid soaring housing costs and gasoline prices. Few of them brought up climate change or were aware the Inflation Reduction Act provided drought relief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've been not buying a lot of things because I can't afford it,\" office worker Melissa Salinas said in an interview outside La Bonita, a Hispanic supermarket in northwest Las Vegas where a gallon of milk costs $4.99, above the national average. \"I'm like, 'The kids don't need juice for school anymore. We'll just do water.'\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Salinas was not familiar with the climate bill, she's worried enough about the drought that she and her family are considering relocating: \"We've looked into moving from here because it was just like, 'Where's the water going to come from?'\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The signs of climate change are everywhere in Nevada this year. Las Vegas reached a record daily high of 109 degrees on June 10 \u2014 so hot that sensors in space picked up the heat. And on the same day that Biden signed the climate bill into law, federal officials informed Nevada policymakers that they must cut the state's water use from the dwindling Colorado River by 8 percent, while National Park Service rangers discovered a fifth set of human remains in the receding waters of Lake Mead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto's GOP challenger, former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, has said little about the Western drought and supports oil and gas drilling, which is helping drive up global temperatures. He has criticized the Inflation Reduction Act, which no Republicans supported, as \"reckless\" spending that will \"fuel inflation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate package authorizes the biggest infusion of federal spending yet to tackle global warming \u2014 roughly $369 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below their 2005 levels by the end of this decade. Democrats have said the measure will reduce Americans' energy costs by providing tax credits for consumers to buy electric vehicles, install solar panels and embrace other climate-friendly technologies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill also sets aside $4 billion for drought mitigation, which will help conserve water in Lake Mead and Lake Powell and pay farmers who voluntarily reduce their water deliveries. Cortez Masto fought to include the drought funding along with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and two other Democratic senators facing tight reelection races: Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kelly, a former astronaut who has seen the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest from space, said in an interview that the drought money \"has little or nothing to do with the election\" and \"everything to do with\" preventing an environmental catastrophe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We can't allow the Colorado River to get down to dead pool,\" Kelly said, referring to when key reservoirs drop so low they would not be able to produce hydropower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Seven Western states in the Colorado River basin last week blew past a deadline to reach an agreement on making unprecedented cuts to their water use. The Bureau of Reclamation responded by announcing Arizona must reduce its water supply by 21 percent, Nevada by 8 percent and the country of Mexico by 7 percent. Larger cuts loom in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laxalt sent a statement on the drought to 8 News Now, a local news outlet, after initially declining to comment on the issue. He endorsed \"long-term solutions that take an all-of-the-above approach, including desalination in California and Arizona.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Big Oil and wildfires</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto has held several events focused on issues besides climate change, including a recent roundtable on how the Inflation Reduction Act will lower prescription drug costs for older Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In her first campaign ad of the general election, however, Cortez Masto accused Laxalt of being bankrolled by large oil and gas companies, a leading contributor to global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Where you find Big Oil, you'll find Adam Laxalt,\" a narrator says in the ad, as the phrases \"Big Oil\" and \"Adam Laxalt\" interlock on a crossword puzzle. \"He's been on their side for years.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Nevada's attorney general from 2015 to 2019, Laxalt opposed efforts by Democratic attorneys general to investigate whether oil companies misled the public about climate change. During his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2018, a super PAC largely funded by oil interests spent $2.5 million to support his run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a recording obtained by The Washington Post, Laxalt told a crowd of supporters that they need to push back on anyone highlighting his ties to Big Oil companies or claiming that those companies are responsible for high gasoline prices. (As of Friday, a gallon of gas cost an average of $4.89 in Nevada and $3.87 nationally, according to AAA.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You can't survive an economy where you go to $2 gas to $5.50, $6 gas,\" Laxalt said in the recording of the Southern Hills Republican Women luncheon in late July. \"And who is responsible for it? We all know it is not [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. And it is not greedy oil executives. And it is certainly not the private citizen.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokesman for Laxalt's campaign, Brian Freimuth, blamed high gas prices on Democrats. \"Biden Masto policies are the reason that energy prices have skyrocketed and Nevada voters are demanding change,\" Freimuth said in an email.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent weeks, Cortez Masto's campaign has also run two ads touting her efforts to include funding for wildfire management and prevention in last year's bipartisan infrastructure law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Catherine has been a vital partner to the fire service, and we know that we have her full support,\" Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran says in one of the ads, which shows firefighters battling a wall of orange flames during last year's destructive fire season.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laxalt has attributed recent blazes to poor forest management rather than global warming, though a growing body of research shows climate change has increased wildfires' frequency and intensity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Adam believes that proper forest management is essential to preventing the spread of dangerous wildfires and has emphasized his intention to fully support the brave officials working to protect Nevada lands,\" Freimuth said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Courting key constituencies</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democratic strategists remain optimistic that the drought money will help boost turnout for Cortez Masto \u2014 especially among the working-class and Latino voters who have formed the core of the Democratic machine built by the late Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think it will resonate with Nevadans who are sick of seeing inaction on things like climate change and drought,\" said Megan Jones, a Nevada operative working with the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cortez Masto, the only Latina ever elected to the Senate, has sought to bolster her standing with Hispanic voters, a demographic that Biden won by 26 percentage points in the state in 2020. Her campaign started running Spanish-language ads in March and recently hosted a boisterous party at a community center with tables for Latin American countries and Mexican states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laxalt's campaign has unveiled its own strategy \u2014 dubbed \"Latinos for Laxalt\" \u2014 aimed at countering this approach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, Cortez Masto's climate pitch should resonate with Latinos, who are more vulnerable to climate impacts than many Americans. Nationwide, Latinos are 43 percent more likely than others to lose work hours and pay because of extreme heat, according to a report released last year by the Environmental Protection Agency. In Florida, Latino immigrants from Central and South America have collapsed from heatstroke while working at plant nurseries on especially hot days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Obed Castaneda, a part-time graphic designer and Uber driver, said he probably won't vote in the midterms because he doubts it would make a difference. He, too, had not heard of the $4 billion for drought mitigation in the climate bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Castaneda said many voters in Las Vegas are too busy working, whether at the bustling casinos on the Strip or other businesses around town, to pay attention to politics. He joked that the billboards on the Strip \u2014 whose neon letters advertise the newest concerts, comedy shows and gentleman's clubs \u2014 should instead spread awareness about the drought funding to residents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I want to see a freakin' billboard down the freakin' Strip,\" he said. \"You got that much money? Let's see it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young voters, who consistently rank climate change as a higher priority, account for 29.5 percent of registered Nevada voters and could play a key role in the race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Cortez Masto may not get much help from youth climate activists. The Las Vegas chapter of the Sunrise Movement, a key advocacy group, has declined to endorse her because she does not support the Green New Deal, the liberal proposal to eliminate the nation's fossil fuel use within a decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Dexter Lim, a 19-year-old co-founder of the chapter, said he prefers Cortez Masto to Laxalt, given her stronger support for renewable energy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Of course we have to support her in this race because the alternative is much, much worse,\" Lim said.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 8}

The Cairo-based artist has made the threat of a warming planet more visceral with an immersive installation \"Heaven and Hell in the Anthropocene,\" a reference to the current, human-centric geological age.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Installed in an area known as the Green Zone at COP27, the artwork features two unlabeled rooms \u2014 described as \"scenarios of eternity\" \u2014 that have different temperatures, sights, sounds and smells meant to represent two possible outcomes for humanity. Inspired by a 2011 study that suggests people who are in warm surroundings are more likely to say climate change is a problem, the piece, made in collaboration with the arts and social justice organization Fine Acts, underscores the physical and personal stakes of a global issue that, for many, can seem abstract and unmanageable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are trying to address climate anxiety by gamifying and simplifying scientific data, by making it relatable to everyday people and helping them feel like they have the power to make decisions,\" Shehab, 45, told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \"We just see floods and we see the news and we're scared. [The installation] is powerful because I can tell you something that's really complex in a very simple way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COP27 comes at the end of a year that has seen disastrous flooding in Pakistan, mudslides in South Africa, drought in China and heat waves in Europe and the United States. Through this sensory installation, Shehab hopes to give visitors a sense of agency and challenge those who say there is nothing we can do. She wants to make the threat feel immediate and tangible \u2014 but not insurmountable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's something instinctive. It doesn't have to do with our brains. It has to do with our biology,\" Shehab says of the psychology behind the artwork. The installation also taps into deeply ingrained spiritual beliefs, she said. \"The religious discourse that we've been fed for, like, millennia says, if you're bad, you'll burn in hell. Heat is bad.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before entering the installation viewers respond to a questionnaire: One question asks participants if they would agree to limit showering to four minutes, wash only with a bar of soap and reuse a day-old towel to conserve water and limit plastic usage. At the end, participants receive a score, which sends them to a room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some will find themselves in a light, domed interior set at a comfortable temperature in the low to mid-70s, surrounded by nature sounds and scents of \"freshness, orange blossoms,\" Shehab said. Others will find a dark, claustrophobic space set around 95 degrees and reeking of decomposing fruit and hospital rooms. So far, Shehab said she has sent 537 people to \"hell\" and 969 to \"heaven\" in what she calls a \"very interesting social experiment.\" Later, she encourages them to visit the other room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The piece is based on the concept of \"visceral fit\": the theory that \"people will judge states of the world associated with their current visceral experiences as more likely,\" according to researchers Jane Risen and Clayton Critcher. Thirst, for example, can increase expectations of drought and desertification. Warmth can increase concern about climate global warming. We think with our bodies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is in direct conflict with the way climate change has been historically discussed \u2014 with graphs and numbers and jargon. Shehab wants to counter that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I wanted a concept that everybody could understand,\" she said. \"I've had site workers and doctors and professors and climate activists and professionals and everybody walk through, and they all get it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While she recognizes that questions of personal responsibility \u2014 whether you recycle, for example \u2014 are only one small piece of the puzzle, she doesn't discount them. Her work is aimed at places where conversations about climate change are more limited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yes, we need to talk to the high polluters. We need to talk to those flying their private jets to COP,\" she said. \"But we also need to talk to developing nations with simpler discourses. And we really need education.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ever since she was a child, Shehab has admired climate activists, and in 2020 she got into the fray herself, building a pyramid of garbage in Cairo that stood nearly 20 feet high. It was meant to contrast the majestic pyramids of Giza with our current \"overproducing, over-consuming\" existence, she wrote in an artist's statement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shehab, who is also a street artist and an art and design professor at the American University in Cairo, has long used art as a political and educational tool. During the Arab Spring, she created calligraphy-inspired graffiti with messages such as \"No to a new pharaoh\" and \"No to violence,\" written around Cairo. And while Britain was preparing to vote on Brexit, she wrote \"No to Borders\" and \"No to Brexit\" on walls in London.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In \"Heaven and Hell in the Anthropocene,\" which will be replicable, under an open license, after COP closes, Shehab wants people to say yes: Yes to wearing secondhand clothes; yes to conserving water; yes to anything they can do to curb climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both rooms of the installation, viewers will find mirrors \u2014 broken ones in hell and curved ones in heaven. The artist hopes they prompt reflection: \"For us to really face our future, we really need to look at ourselves.\"\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

Dino Grandoni, a national environment reporter for The Washington Post, wrote the top of today's newsletter. Below we have the latest on Hurricane Ian's devastating impact in Florida. But first:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As temperatures rise and habitats shrink, hundreds of thousands of plant and animal species around the world are at risk of vanishing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time, the United States is designating a special diplomat to advocate for global biodiversity amid what policymakers here and overseas increasingly recognize as an extinction crisis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monica Medina is taking on a new role as special envoy for biodiversity and water resources, the State Department announced Wednesday. She currently serves as the department's assistant secretary for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appointment underscores the Biden administration's desire to protect land and waters not just at home but to also conserve habitats abroad.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The loss of biodiversity isn't just a tragedy for wildlife. It's one of the biggest threats facing humanity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a major U.N. report in 2019, a million species face possible extinction, with dire implications for humans who depend on ecosystems for food, fresh water and other resources. Overfishing, pollution, pesticides, disease, urban sprawl and, of course, climate change contribute to declines in imperiled species' populations worldwide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's a direct connection between biodiversity loss and instability in a lot of parts of the world,\" Medina said in a recent phone interview. \"It's not just about nature for nature's sake. I think it is about people.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the Biden administration, Medina was an adjunct professor at Georgetown's Walsh School of Foreign Service and worked as general counsel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other government roles. She is the wife of White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her appointment comes weeks ahead of a major biodiversity conference in mid-December in Montreal. The meeting originally was scheduled to take place in the Chinese city of Kunming in 2020 but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The aim of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity \u2014 also known as COP-15 \u2014 is for nations to reverse the loss of species by adopting an international framework for conserving biodiversity. The effort is akin to the climate talks in 2015 that yielded the Paris agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the United States wants out of the conference: For nations to commit to conserving 30 percent of their land and water area. \"We are looking for ways to reach that goal, because that's what scientists tell us we need in order to have a healthy planet,\" Medina said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One big hurdle: Defining what, exactly, counts as land and water conserved? \"That is part of the discussion, is what counts,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the United States doing its part? President Biden set a goal of conserving nearly a third of the nation's land and waters by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden has taken a few steps toward that target, restoring protections for two desert expanses in Utah and reinstating fishing restrictions in a marine monument off New England. Both moves reversed decisions made by President Donald Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Biden administration has yet to identify many other specific places for new protections. Medina noted that the Inflation Reduction Act passed this year set aside billions of dollars for conservation funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rising seas flood forests and kill trees. Increasing temperatures allow for the greater spread of disease, such as an avian form of malaria that is wiping out birds in Hawaii. Warming waters leach out oxygen, suffocating marine life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But protecting ecosystems such as forests and peatlands, Medina noted, will help keep climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere in the first place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's a crisis that we face that's interwoven with the climate crisis, but also independent and important on its own,\" she said. \"If we can solve the biodiversity crisis, we're a long way along the way to solving the climate crisis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Update: This story has been updated to include that Medina is married to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Ian gradually weakened into a tropical storm early Thursday, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. Although storm surge is thought to have already peaked, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned late Wednesday that decimation is likely to continue throughout the state, Jason Samenow, Kelly Kasulis Cho and Annabelle Timsit report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center said Ian, which is tearing toward Florida's Atlantic coast, is expected to further weaken Friday night and into Saturday, but \"could be near hurricane strength\" on Friday when it approaches South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 2.5 million customers are without power, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages across the country. Conditions are expected to deteriorate as Ian moves inland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ian jumped from a Category 3 storm Tuesday night to just shy of a Category 5 on Wednesday morning, a distinct marker of climate change. The rapid intensification of storms, which has occurred more frequently in recent decades, is tied to rising ocean temperatures. The warmer water helps fuel hurricanes, allowing them to grow, strengthen and release more rain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other updates include:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The monster storm will drop 12 to 20 inches of rain over central and northeast Florida, with localized amounts up to 30 inches, according to the National Hurricane Center. Flash flooding is one of the most serious threats from tropical storms because it happens quickly and occurs far from shore. The slow-moving nature of Ian means that torrents of rain will fall across the state for a longer period of time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a news briefing Wednesday night, DeSantis said there would be an influx of personnel and supplies available to those in need, and that first responders would probably be able to reach residents in high-risk areas when conditions are safer at first light Thursday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>DeSantis also sent an official letter to President Biden on Wednesday requesting a major disaster declaration for the entire state, asking for full federal reimbursement of response and recovery costs for the first 60 days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The swath of coastline that is facing the most disastrous effects from Hurricane Ian has been undergoing rapid development in recent decades, putting exponentially more assets and people in harm's way, The Washington Post's Simon Ducroquet, Brady Dennis and John Muyskens report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From 1970 to 2020, census records show that the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area expanded by 623 percent to more than 760,000 people. At the same time, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area saw growth of more than 187 percent and is now home to more than 3.1 million people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stephen Strader, a hazards geographer and professor at Villanova University, said as more people and businesses move to the beach, it creates an overwhelming opportunity for weather-related disasters to wreak havoc.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Then throw on sea level rise and climate change on top of that, and you are looking at a multi-headed monster,\" Strader said. \"We really haven't done much to check this growth. \u2026 What we are finding out is that is not sustainable.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) on Tuesday said that he was pulling his energy permitting plan from a stopgap government funding bill, many environmental groups rejoiced. But the bill also included a provision to rapidly expand transmission lines, which are crucial for helping the United States meet its bold climate goals, Shannon Osaka reports for The Post.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Manchin's bill, dubbed the Energy Independence and Security Act, was intended to help speed the approval process for new clean and fossil-fuel energy projects by setting up a two-year target for environmental reviews and granting the federal government the authority to build transmission lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, many climate activists argued that although the bill would accelerate the nation's transition to clean energy, its potential benefits do not outweigh the harms of locking in additional greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, those power lines are necessary for carrying renewable electricity from sunny and windy areas of the country to urban centers. According to an analysis from Princeton University, the newly passed Inflation Reduction Act could cut U.S. emissions 40 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. But that calculation hinges on whether the nation manages to increase transmission by 2.3 percent per year. If transmission grows only 1 percent per year, the modelers predict that 80 percent of the new climate law's benefits could be lost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>European Union leaders on Wednesday launched investigations into random, simultaneous breaches of three major underwater natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea, pointing to Russian sabotage, Meg Kelly and Michael Birnbaum report for The Post.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts said the blasts potentially mark the largest-ever single release of methane into the atmosphere from the energy sector. The gas is more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere. Thomas Lauvaux, a researcher with the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France, said that in a worst-case scenario the leak could cause the same amount of planet-warming pollution that 1 million cars do in a year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell vowed a \"robust and united response\" to any attacks on the 27-nation bloc's energy infrastructure. Though the probes have only just begun, many politicians blamed Russia, saying that the explosions are the next step in the Kremlin's strategy as it continues to wage a war in Ukraine and use energy supplies as leverage over Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called accusations that Russia was responsible for the explosions \"predictably stupid\" and \"absurd.\" He told reporters on a call that Moscow has no interest in damaging the pipelines \u2014 which are majority-owned Russian entities \u2014 because of the high value of the gas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Photos: Hurricane Ian makes landfall in Florida as Category 4 \u2014 The Post</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hurricane Ian is pulling water away from ocean shores.

Really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom took the stage to cheers in the hot afternoon sun in Orange County the other day. For 20 minutes, he talked about the Democratic candidates for Congress and the California Legislature. He talked about President Trump. He talked about poverty, homelessness, immigration and global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there was one topic that Mr. Newsom, the lieutenant governor, barely mentioned: the fact that he is the Democratic candidate for governor of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom\u2019s decision to glide over that point is testimony to his dominant position in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. As a Democrat in a lopsidedly blue state, Mr. Newsom is far ahead of his Republican opponent, the business executive John Cox, in polls. And a key purpose of his campaign swing, he said, is to promote Democratic candidates for Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with the threat of an economic downturn, escalating hostility with the Trump White House, and looming decisions about how to respond to entrenched poverty, climate change and a dysfunctional state tax system, California may be entering turbulent waters. And Mr. Newsom\u2019s low-risk campaign, along with a widespread sense that the outcome of the contest is almost a foregone conclusion, suggests voters may learn little between now and Election Day about Mr. Newsom\u2019s qualifications and what he intends to do should he take over as the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox have not agreed to any televised debates. Mr. Cox, trailing in fund-raising , has struggled to draw attention to his attacks on Mr. Newsom. \u201cPoliticians like Gavin Newsom talk about change, but they\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Mr. Cox said in a radio advertisement airing across the state. Only the occasional television crew and handful of reporters have turned up for Mr. Newsom\u2019s stops.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t think this campaign will test him,\u201d said Jim Newton, a lecturer on public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cAnd that\u2019s too bad. He\u2019s a quality candidate. It\u2019s too bad we are not given a chance to see more of him and learn what he would do. I think he plays defense through Election Day.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom asserted that California voters had plenty of opportunities to learn about him during a career in public service that included a turn as mayor of San Francisco and as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the trail for three years,\u201d he said, as his four young children scampered up and down his campaign bus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe question of being challenged, of what kind of governor are you going to be: We\u2019ve had that vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been as scrutinized as much as any candidate for political office in some time, in terms of my tenure as mayor, my tenure as county supervisor.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom said that voters were most interested in talking about the president. \u201cMy town halls, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care, Trump. Environment, Trump. Jobs, economy, Trump. Anxiety, fear, Trump.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, Mr. Newsom has spent more than seven years as Mr. Brown\u2019s lieutenant governor, a low-profile position that has little authority or assigned duties. It has proved to be a particularly obscure role under the shadow of a governor like Mr. Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom won widespread attention as mayor of San Francisco \u2014 where, among other things, he championed same-sex marriage at a time when it was a contentious issue even in his own party. Still, being mayor of a city of 871,000 people does not present the same challenges that come with being the leader of a state like California, with a population of 39.4 million people, an increasingly assertive State Legislature and an ever-expanding catalog of problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Newsom so far has offered often vague responses on some of the biggest issues he would face: global warming, the over-budget high-speed rail train between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the state\u2019s volatile tax code, which Mr. Newsom has said needs an overhaul, while saying it was too early to say how.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom signaled during the primary that he would support a California-financed single-payer health care program, over the objections of opponents who said it was unaffordable. Since his primary victory, Mr. Newsom has said it was unlikely to be accomplished during his first term as governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cSomeone said, \u2018you are backtracking on single-payer,\u2019\u201d he said, when pressed on the question. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually expressing an outline. I\u2019m architecting the conversation over the next few years. It\u2019s not an act that is going to occur by a signature of a governor.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Newsom, an opponent of the death penalty, said he had not decided what to do if he is forced to preside over the first execution in more than a decade in a state that has more inmates on death row \u2014 over 700 \u2014 than any other. In 2016, California passed a proposition forcing the state to resume executions, although there are legal challenges outstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would Mr. Newsom sign a death warrant? \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to answer the question,\u201d he said, clearly struggling with the issue. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not prepared to answer the question. But I am preparing myself to answer the question. And in that preparation comes a lot of soul searching.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, said a central question is how Mr. Newsom might reconcile his liberal appeal from the primary with running a state. \u201cSince he positioned himself in the primary in the progressive wing of the party, what will he do when presented with legislation that, while popular in the party, will be difficult to implement in government?\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Brown from his first days as lieutenant governor. Mr. Newsom recounted how shortly after he took office, he put out his own economic plan for California \u2014 and was quickly reminded who was in charge by Mr. Brown\u2019s office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, he faces the challenge of trying to at once align himself with the popular Mr. Brown while acknowledging criticisms that Mr. Cox and others have offered on the governor and what has taken place under his watch in California, from housing costs to homelessness to growing poverty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhat happened to our state?\u201d he said in Seal Beach. In Torrance, he called homelessness \u201cthe ultimate manifestation of our failure. It happened on our watch. We own that.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cUnless we deal with the affordability crisis, the California Dream will no longer exist,\u201d he said after he got back on his bus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom said he would expect pressure from lawmakers to restore spending that Mr. Brown had cut. He said he would mostly continue Mr. Brown\u2019s frugal ways, but signaled he was ready to spend money in areas where Mr. Brown had not \u2014 in particular, early childhood education and higher education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI get why people worry about it, because if immediately you connote me with San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi, everything \u2014 I get where that anxiety comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will soon learn that I am going to be very stubborn as it relates to the budget and fiscal discipline. At the same time less stubborn on some investments that Jerry has understandably danced around.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Newsom said the outgoing governor had left the state \u201cin better shape than probably any governor in modern times.\u201d But he said that Mr. Brown had given him a somewhat mordant warning as they discussed what was around the corner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201c\u2018Good luck,\u2019\u201d he quoted Mr. Brown as saying. \u201c\u2019Cause he sees the headwinds, he sees the fixed costs, he sees the hockey stick of health care and pensions. He sees all this building pressure, he knows what the Legislature is revving up to do and all these interest groups that are a deeper part of that appetite than the Legislature. They are all expecting the next governor to solve their problems.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At 50, Mr. Newsom retains the aura of glamour from his days as a young mayor, with a full head of slicked-back hair. When he showed up to speak for an assembly candidate running in the South Bay of Los Angeles, Democrats clamored outside his bus, waiting to catch a view or a photograph. He emerged carrying boxes of pizza.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHe\u2019s so photogenic,\u201d said Carol Pike-Bauer, 92, a retired chemical engineer. She said she had been following his career since he was San Francisco mayor and admired his willingness to go against the federal government on gay marriage. \u201cHe did what he thought was right and fair,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As mayor, Mr. Newsom\u2019s personal life was also terrain for the gossip columns. He was a fixture on the city\u2019s party circuit, and later admitted to an affair with the wife of his campaign manager. He got a divorce and underwent treatment for alcohol abuse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, Mr. Newsom travels the state with his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker, and their children. His son Hunter, 7, kept tugging at the back of his pants, clamoring for attention as Mr. Newsom tried to speak at the rally here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Californians who turned up for his events said they were pleased to hear him talk about issues like global warming and immigration, even in Republican parts of the state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe do have a strong Republican base here \u2014 some issues he\u2019s talking about people will disapprove of,\u201d said John Henry Lopez, 47, a plumber who came to hear him speak in Fresno. \u201cBut he will be helped by the cost of health care. That\u2019s a strong message that can get people to vote.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brock Neeley, 53, who drove from Tulare to see Mr. Newsom in Fresno, said the area is \u201cturning blue, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cPeople are finally getting fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cFarmers who voted for Trump are seeing their crops in the field. Global warming affects us big time.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his speeches, delivered without notes and in shirt sleeves, Mr. Newsom plucked quotes from Aristotle, Plutarch, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Oliver Wendell Holmes as he presented himself as the next face of the Democratic opposition in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While his first advertisement was upbeat, focusing on prenatal care and job training, he made clear that future advertisements are likely to focus on Mr. Cox\u2019s connections to the president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cMy opponent has doubled down on all things Trump,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, in one of the few times he mentioned his opponent by name. \u201cThat\u2019s a very challenging place for Cox to be.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Adam Nagourney and Tim Arango\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

As she crossed the wide marsh in the dark, the water rose quickly. It became too deep -- ahead and behind. She had to stop and wait.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To her, no longer were climate change predictions an abstract idea. Sea level has been rising, taking her waterfront with it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This isn't something that's coming,\" she later told a group of bay shore residents and officials. \"It's here. We just happen to live in a place that will affect us sooner.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wren lives on tiny Money Island -- more a peninsula of bayfront land -- with about 40 small homes and trailers in Cumberland County.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just visible across the grassy marsh is Gandys Beach with 80 homes. Farther south, Fortescue with 250 homes. All three are steadily disappearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Atlantic coast, beach replenishment masks the effects of sea level rise. But along the low-lying bay shore, veined with creeks, the problems are striking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With each nor'easter, more of the beachfronts erode. More of the streets and driveways flood. Septic systems, inundated with saltwater, are failing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're seeing beyond the normal damage,\" said Steve Eisenhauer, a regional director with the Natural Lands Trust, which has a 7,000-acre preserve in the area. \"We see the problems getting worse.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the last century, sea level in the bay has risen a foot, gauges show, partly because the warming ocean is expanding and polar ice is melting. Also, New Jersey is sinking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the while, humans have been pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The planet's average temperature has increased.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"All those links are very strong,\" said Pennsylvania State University's Raymond Najjar Jr., an expert on climate change in Mid-Atlantic estuaries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The reason the sea is rising as fast as it is in the Delaware Bay is human-induced climate change,\" he said, echoing many experts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sea level is rising faster now than in the early 20th century, and scientists expect it to rise even faster in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three towns' beachfronts and marshes have always been nibbled away by ship wakes, storms and more typical erosion -- but a rising sea level, combined with more frequent and intense storms, makes them all worse.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Can these three communities, all within Downe Township, adapt to climate change?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or is there a point beyond which no amount of money can stop the sea? Should everyone relocate?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's been done. After a $1.8-million seawall in nearby Sea Breeze failed a year after being built, the state bought out the 23 remaining households three years ago for $3.3 million. Tiny Thompson's Beach and Moore's Beach are gone too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are special places, where people look out their windows and see eagles soaring. The bay turns red at sunset. Salt marshes thick with aquatic life stretch for miles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With marinas in Fortescue and Money Island, they are among the last places in South Jersey where people can access Delaware Bay -- vital for generating support to preserve the rich habitat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, like Wren, residents sometimes see whitecaps in their driveways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Downe officials have come up with a $50-million plan to not only shore up the shore, but also add amenities across the township to draw tourists who could revive the economy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plan, which would cost the equivalent of $31,500 per resident, calls for bulkheads and truckloads of sand, restrooms, picnic benches, nature-viewing areas and a township visitor center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Officials identified nearly 30 \"potential\" funders -- including agencies and nonprofit groups. But many feel the project is a long shot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, bumper stickers are plastered on homes: \"No retreat. Save the Bayshore communities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I refuse to give up one house, one lot, one piece of land,\" said Robert Campbell, Downe's mayor. \"These towns are 200 years old. It's a special place. We've got to preserve it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their survival is also fiscally crucial; they represent half of Downe's tax base.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He and others blame flooding not on a rising sea level but on the decline of dikes once used for salt hay farming. Scientists say the dikes blocked the tides from naturally bolstering mashes with sediment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Campbell also accuses the state of being too tough in issuing permits for bulkheads and jetties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Hurricane Irene struck in 2011, the town put up temporary bulkheads. The state issued violation notices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, those structures need restoration too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>::</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before modern travel made all the Atlantic beaches easily accessible, Delaware Bay was the shore that many Philadelphians went to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the late 1800s, Fortescue was the Cape May of the bay shore, with hotels and a boardwalk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are so rich in our history,\" said Dennis Cook of Money Island, who specified in his will that his ashes be thrown off his pier. \"We can survive.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or at least they feel compelled to try. Many residents are retirees who have sunk their savings into their homes. Now that prices have fallen, they can't get out unless the state buys them out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nine Money Island property owners have already requested that.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is Tony Novak, owner of the local marina. He wants to stay, and thinks he can for the near future, but \"there is no doubt that the only reasonable, logical, long-term approach is strategic retreat.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I have neighbors,\" he said, \"and all they have left in the world is being washed away.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In October, Wren held a forum named for what many consider the hot issue for the bay shore: \"Rising Tides.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 100 people went to the nearby hamlet of Bivalve on the Maurice River and filled a chilly room in a historic shipyard shed owned by the nonprofit Bayshore Discovery Project, which Wren founded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It owns New Jersey's tall ship, a historic oyster schooner called the A.J. Meerwald, and the walls of the room were lined with vintage oyster cans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Outside, docks built in the early 1900s still exist, and old-timers notice that the tide comes up higher than it used to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the serpentine Maurice River, erosion -- a natural process worsened by sea level rise -- has almost cut through the bend at Bivalve. If it occurs, the docks might end up high and dry, and land to the east will flood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward the bay are \"ghost forests\" -- skeletons of trees killed by saltwater intrusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Upstream, a quarter-century of bird counts shows that black vultures, a Southern species, are becoming more numerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In decline are American black ducks, which depend on a freshwater wild rice that is being depleted as saltier water moves up the Maurice River.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The coast is changing,\" Jennifer Adkins told the group in Bivalve that night.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The executive director of the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, she cited research showing the dramatic loss of the bay's wetlands. Nearly 5,000 football fields' worth vanished from 1996 to 2006 alone, mostly from sea level rise and erosion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wetlands protect coastal areas by absorbing water from storm surges, so losing these natural buffers makes the bay shore communities more vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matt Blake, then with the American Littoral Society, raised the topic few wanted to hear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Strategic retreat,\" he said. \"The questions of whether to pull back or reinforce are going to come up again and again.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't claim to have an answer. But he said solutions should be based on research, not emotion. \"We'll never have enough resources to defend every community. Before we start spending on new roads and bridges and pipes, we have to run a cost-benefit analysis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Campbell wouldn't hear of it. \"There seems to be a double standard between the Atlantic coast communities and the Delaware Bay,\" the mayor said when he got to the lectern. A murmur of assent rose from the audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't hear anybody talking about retreat in Atlantic City,\" he said. Or \"moving the casinos back to Absecon.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he handed out a summary of township problems: collapsed pavement, eroded road shoulders, failing seawalls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Downe Township is just one hurricane away from becoming a bayfront statistic\" like the three other abandoned towns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eleven days later, Superstorm Sandy hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bayfront houses were undermined, the sand washing out from under them. Front steps hung in the air. Decks and front rooms were gone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Campbell said damage along the bay front totaled $20 million; about 30 homes were destroyed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Sandy focused everybody's attention,\" Wren said. \"You can't just quietly ignore [the rising ocean] anymore.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Bauers writes for the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: MAYOR BOB CAMPBELL of Downe Township stands by storm-damaged homes in Fortescue. \"I refuse to give up one house, one lot, one piece of land,\" he said.; PHOTOGRAPHER:Charles Fox Philadelphia Inquirer; PHOTO: HOMES ALONG DELAWARE BAY, including in Fortescue, N.J., have been damaged or destroyed by erosion and storms.

What if we grew new forests on vacant city lots, old industrial buildings \u2014 even golf courses?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time, scientists have sought to quantify this thought experiment. How many trees could be planted on every available parcel of land on Earth, where they could go, and what impact could that have on our survival?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They concluded that the planet could support nearly 2.5 billion additional acres of forest without shrinking our cities and farms, and that those additional trees, when they mature, could store a whole lot of the extra carbon \u2014 200 gigatons of carbon, to be precise \u2014 generated by industrial activity over the last 150 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parts of the study \u2014 led by researchers at ETH Zurich, a university that specializes in science, technology and engineering \u2014 were immediately criticized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The critics did not dispute that 200 gigatons of carbon could be absorbed by trees if you planted them on every space of land available. They disputed the implications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study\u2019s authors asserted that, under their model, forest restoration could absorb two-thirds of historic emissions. Zeke Hausfather, an analyst for the climate science website Carbon Brief, said the true figure would be closer to one-third. That\u2019s because part of the emissions absorbed by the additional trees would have been absorbed by the soil or the seas anyway.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say that reforestation is not an important mitigation strategy, just to caution that like every other climate solution, it\u2019s part of a larger portfolio of strategies rather than a silver bullet,\u201d Mr. Hausfather said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, an Australia-based scientific group that produces global carbon budgets, said that reforestation \u201cwon\u2019t fix the climate problem, albeit it should be part of the solution.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senior author of the study, Thomas Crowther, a professor of environmental systems science at ETH Zurich, acknowledged that mass reforestation would not be a quick fix for climate change but said it would result in an \u201cunexpectedly huge carbon drawdown solution\u201d in the long term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe new information simply allows us to re-prioritize investment into the restoration of forests and the conservation of existing forests as this has more potential for carbon capture than we could have anticipated,\u201d he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the start of the industrial age, the average global temperature has risen by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, because of accelerating greenhouse gas emissions. Temperatures are on track to rise even more in the coming years, raising the prospects of debilitating heat waves, wildfires and rising seas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason forests are important is that they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and incorporate it into their roots and branches. That absorbed carbon becomes part of the soil when trees die and decompose. Depending on factors like temperature and soil management, it can remain there for millenniums.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some cases \u2014 like when there is a forest fire, or when a drought or pest infestation destroys a large number of trees \u2014 a forest can release more carbon than it absorbs. But one study, led by University of Arizona researchers, found that even mass die-offs of trees release less carbon than expected into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest United Nations-backed climate science panel has estimated that it would take 2.5 billion acres of new forest cover to stave off the most devastating impacts of climate change. The study led by ETH Zurich tried to quantify where on Earth new trees could be grown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The researchers used Google Earth to generate maps of what they call Earth\u2019s tree-carrying capacity, taking into account the effects of rising temperatures in the near-term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A handful of countries could make a very big difference. The researchers found that Russia could restore 373 million acres, or 151 million hectares, of forest. That was followed by the United States, with 255 million acres and Canada with 193 million acres. Other large countries like Australia, Brazil and China also have large areas suitable for forest restoration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

How dare you!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear.  How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you're doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency.  But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that.  Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil.  And that I refuse to believe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1. 5 degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty percent may be acceptable to you.  But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice.  They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us \u2014 we who have to live with the consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1. 5 degrees global temperature rise \u2014 the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] \u2014 the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on Jan.  1, 2018.  Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just \"business as usual\" and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than eight and a half years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You are failing us.

The report spurred the White House to make plans for an internal working group to counter the scientific consensus that climate change represents a major threat to the United States and the globe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For a president who has yet to receive an extensive scientific briefing on climate change, the topic amounts to a political litmus test ahead of the 2020 elections. Rather than accept the conclusions espoused by elites and loathed by many of his voters, Trump has opted to question the premise that global warming represents a major problem or, at times, if it even exists at all. And now through its new working group, his National Security Council is working to muster ammunition for his arguments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meade Krosby, a senior scientist at the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group, said the initiative showed a disconnect with reality. The world has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial levels, and a recent U.N. scientific report concluded the world will have to cut its carbon output 45\u00a0percent by 2030 to avert some of the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The idea that what we really need is to revisit the basic science of climate change when we are already feeling its impacts is absurd,\" she said. \"There is no meaningful scientific disagreement on the facts.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Steven Milloy, a climate change skeptic who served on Trump's transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency and questioned humans' contribution to climate change, said Trump is simply keeping his promise to millions of voters who backed him in 2016 after he campaigned on the energy policies he is now pursuing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't have a problem with people having different points of view. It's the president that gets elected,\" said Milloy, who previously ran a group that received funding from the oil industry. \"In the end, it's the president agenda, and he gets to decide.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House's push against climate science has exposed a modest rift within the Republican Party, as some are edging toward a more centrist position. And it has provided a potential political opportunity for Democrats, who have been grappling with their own intraparty fight over how ambitious to be when it comes to cutting carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced this week that all 47 senators in the Democratic caucus had signed on to a resolution saying that climate change is real, caused by humans and that Congress needs to take immediate action on it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Tuesday, former Ohio governor John Kasich (R), who ran against Trump in 2016, said recent federal reports have settled the debate over climate science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The government is giving us reports saying this is [a] problem,\" Kasich said at a University of British Columbia lecture. \"And the Defense Department and America's preparing for climate change, global warming and the implications of it all. So there are very little questions anymore.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump sees the climate debate as a war of political messaging, according to several current and former administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. Convinced that the scientific literature on climate change is funded and directed by liberals, he has said on repeated occasions that he expects the climate to change back to colder average temperatures. It amounts to an endorsement of the \"global cooling\" forecast some researchers made in the 1970s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Trump and his aides discussed whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement two years ago, he emphasized the impact low-carbon policies could have on average Americans. Under the accord, the United States pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions between 26 and 28\u00a0percent by 2025.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Trump occasionally asks aides for their opinions on climate change, he has been unwavering in his denial that human activity bears the brunt of the blame.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"When you talk to him about it, he's openly skeptical,\" George David Banks, who served as special assistant to the president for international energy and environment during the start of Trump's term, said in an interview. \"The reason he's skeptical is he sees it as being detrimental to U.S. manufacturing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Deputies who have sought to make the case for climate action to Trump have not fared well. During a meeting just weeks before the president announced the United States would exit the Paris agreement, then-National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn noted that several major chief executives had just published a joint letter urging him to stay within the deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Gary, my voters don't live on Park Avenue,\" Trump responded, according to one participant who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. \"They don't care about the same things you care about.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris deal in 2017, climate change has rarely come up as a priority inside the White House, according to current and former officials. \"He knows his voters see it as bunk,\" a White House official said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's views have been largely consistent for the better part of a decade, as he has railed against renewable energy and claimed that environmentalism puts U.S. industry at a disadvantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's rejection of climate science stretches back to at least 2010. Shortly after signing a letter calling for U.S. action to combat climate change, Trump changed course and began calling the whole concept \"a con,\" voicing many of the same arguments he uses today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a February 2010 interview on Fox News, Trump noted the \"freezing\" temperatures at the time, and claimed that the United States was \"scrubbing\" its coal while China, Japan and India pursued dirtier energy, putting American companies \"at a competitive disadvantage.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's probably getting a little bit warmer,\" Trump said. \"And then, in a number of years or decades, it will get a little bit cooler.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2012, he tweeted that \"the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.\" And in the years leading up to his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump continued to opine about global warming, seizing on cold snaps to argue that the science showing rising temperatures and sea levels amounted to a \"hoax.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-science views espoused by Trump allow him to cast aside inconvenient facts and shape an argument that aligns with his political goals and his other long-held views, said Tim O'Brien, author of \"TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's performance art,\" he said. \"I don't think he authentically believes climate change was authored in Beijing. He just knows that it dovetails neatly with his anti-China, anti-free-trade, anti-climate-change mantra. And he can put that to political use.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has already begun targeting his potential 2020 opponents over their environmental positions. The president also touted January's frigid temperatures in much of the United States but ignored his government's announcement two weeks later that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures,\" Trump tweeted after the Democratic senator from Minnesota made her presidential announcement in a snowstorm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some federal officials in top scientific posts offer a more nuanced view on climate change, but they choose their words carefully.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Certainly, the climate is changing; it has been changing. It's a combination of natural variability and human influence,\" Kelvin Droegemeier, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in an interview last week. \"Over the past 70 years or so, human influence has played a significant role.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2013, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report saying global warming is \"unequivocal\" and that it is \"extremely likely\" that humans are the \"dominant\" cause of climate change over the past century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump own military leaders and intelligence heads have said in public reports that climate change poses a national security threat to the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as president, Trump's views on environmental science have drifted further from the mainstream even as he has had access to the world's greatest scientists and data.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a November interview with The Washington Post, Trump claimed that dirty air from Asia \"blows over\" toward the United States. He also rejected calls for climate action by claiming that U.S. air and water is already \"record clean.\" He has claimed that California's record wildfires in 2018 were caused because of the state's improper \"raking\" of its forests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are convinced that Trump's position on climate change could prove a liability for congressional Republicans, most of whom have raised questions about climate science and worked to reverse Obama-era regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions. Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would force a vote on House Democrats' Green New Deal, a sweeping measure that would spend trillions to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NSC is pressing ahead with its plan to convene federal researchers to decide how the White House might reassess the government's climate findings, and it has asked agencies to find outside experts who endorse the idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kasich, who called on lawmakers Tuesday to impose either a tax on carbon or a nationwide cap on emissions, said that eventually voters would pressure his party to act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Do you know why politicians will finally get off the dime?\" Kasich said. \"Because they'll have no choice.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>juliet.eilperin@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>juliet.eilperin@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>toluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>toluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Josh Dawsey and Tony Romm contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 10}

She had been in Santa Barbara for a workshop and couldn\u2019t take the train home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe track was gone,\u201d she recalled this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So she hitched a ride with a colleague. She remembers seeing the ocean on one side of her and fire on the other as they drove. \u201cIt was like heaven and hell.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That year, fires tore through the San Diego region, leaving 16 people dead and 2,400 homes destroyed. One of the blazes, the Cedar fire, was at the time the largest in California history, burning more than 273,000 acres.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, that record has been demolished as climate change has lengthened fire seasons and caused the blazes themselves to burn hotter and faster. Last year, five of the six largest fires in the state\u2019s known history together chewed through nearly 2.5 million acres. The Cedar fire is now the state\u2019s eighth-largest blaze, and the only one in the top 10 to have taken place before 2010.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, as Altintas told me, technology has also advanced in the years since 2003. That, she said, can help both prevent out-of-control wildfires and minimize the destruction they cause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt gives us hope,\u201d she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Altintas is the founder and director of the university\u2019s WIFIRE Lab, where she and her team have worked over the past eight years to use data to help fire managers and scientists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And in the last decade or so, the quantity of data has increased. A lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where once there were basic weather cameras used by surfers, there are now vast systems taking in almost real-time satellite views, sensing wind patterns, tracking utility service and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All that information, coupled with troves of data about past blazes, can be used with artificial intelligence to quickly predict how fires will burn once they have ignited, and to help plan measures, like prescribed burns, aimed at preventing bigger, more dangerous fires.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s been an information revolution,\u201d Altintas said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She demonstrated the lab\u2019s fire map, which she said was used to help fight every major fire in the state. The interface was intuitive, like a more colorful Google map.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Altintas clicked on filters that showed ongoing fires in detail \u2014 where they were actively burning and where they had already been \u2014 along with the areas that had been burned by fires in the past. She said she could pull up camera views from weather stations or see how a given fire might have burned if conditions had been different, and how close it would have come to where people live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, she said, helps fire officials decide where to send resources to battle a fast-moving blaze and which areas to evacuate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A product known as BurnPro 3D showed, as the name suggests, three-dimensional images of vegetation down to a one-meter resolution. That can help fire managers prioritize where they should intentionally light fires when it\u2019s safe to do so, because they can see where fuels have built up to dangerous levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In coming years, Altintas said, she hopes the fire map and BurnPro 3D will help significantly streamline the permitting process for prescribed burns and will be able to help predict where there is a risk for landslides or flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThose are all very relatable things that can happen at any time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we want to pull together the data and modeling community to model those as fast as we can.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, she emphasized that one of the lab\u2019s most important functions is making data \u2014 and tools for analyzing it \u2014 accessible to a wide range of collaborators across the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That, Altintas said, is the only way that scientists and officials can even attempt to keep up with rapidly changing environmental challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe main thing here is we can\u2019t just react,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more people to say, \u2018We can do something about it.\u2019\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow all of The Times\u2019s heat wave and wildfire coverage here.California spent more than $1 billion on emergency wildfire suppression last year, The San Francisco Chronicle reports.Read about how that\u2019s a fraction of the total cost of wildfires, including damages and health consequences.The Los Angeles Times reports that fires have burned more than 140,000 acres so far this year in California, with the biggest blazes burning faster and hotter than some firefighters have seen this early in the year.Explore WIFIRE Lab\u2019s Firemap, developed with the Orange County Fire Authority, CalOES, the Los Angeles Fire Department and more.And learn more about WIFIRE Commons, developed with federal agencies, the Los Alamos National Lab and dozens of other partners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow all of The Times\u2019s heat wave and wildfire coverage here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California spent more than $1 billion on emergency wildfire suppression last year, The San Francisco Chronicle reports.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read about how that\u2019s a fraction of the total cost of wildfires, including damages and health consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Los Angeles Times reports that fires have burned more than 140,000 acres so far this year in California, with the biggest blazes burning faster and hotter than some firefighters have seen this early in the year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Explore WIFIRE Lab\u2019s Firemap, developed with the Orange County Fire Authority, CalOES, the Los Angeles Fire Department and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And learn more about WIFIRE Commons, developed with federal agencies, the Los Alamos National Lab and dozens of other partners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here\u2019s what else to know today</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The close ties between coroners and law enforcement have fueled an unusual and unregulated industry: for-profit forensic examinations, The New York Times Magazine reports.NBC Los Angeles discussed the homelessness crisis with former Gov.

It estimated the damage to shareholders to be between $476 million and $1.6 billion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Exxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate-change regulation,\" the complaint says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \nEnergy Stocks Fall Faster Than Oil Prices\n(Oct. 16)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon has denied wrongdoing and said a reasonable investor wouldn't expect to know such internal details. The company has also accused the attorneys general involved, all Democrats, of being motivated by politics in bringing the case, which the office has denied.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil industry has said that it is difficult to estimate the future costs of climate-change regulation, which is uncertain politically and varies across national boundaries, as investors have demanded more information.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trial is being watched closely, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at financial-services firm Edward Jones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A verdict in the attorney general's favor could damage Exxon's reputation and bolster federal lawsuits filed by shareholders in Texas and New Jersey that make similar allegations, which Exxon has also denied. It could also spur future investigations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It could open up a big can of worms,\" Ms. Rowland said. \"Other companies could be looked at and questioned about what assumptions they have made.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A win for Exxon could insulate the company from similar suits and would represent another blow for climate-change lawsuits. Federal judges have \ntossed other climate-change cases\n, including when New York, San Francisco and other cities \nsued oil companies in the past several years\nto recoup costs incurred from the effects of rising global temperatures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tuesday's proceedings mark only the second trial of a case where climate change is a central issue in U.S. history, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. In the first, he said, a federal judge in 2007 upheld a Vermont regulation on emissions standards that had been challenged by auto makers and dealers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New York attorney general's office \nsued Exxon last October\n, saying its climate-change disclosure methods were \"sanctioned at the highest levels of the company.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prosecutors said Mr. Tillerson was aware of misrepresentations to investors. They said the then-chief executive used a different email address, with the alias Wayne Tracker, for internal correspondence about these matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokeswoman for Mr. Tillerson referred a request for comment to Exxon. An Exxon spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a deposition, Mr. Tillerson said he used the Wayne Tracker address because of the heavy volume of email going to the account that used his real name. He also referred to differing calculations as an \"academic debate.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Central to the trial is the calculation of proxy costs, or formulas the company used to calculate the risk of future regulation. Such disclosures were important to investors because they spoke to the company's financial health, the attorney general's office said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The differences were sometimes stark. In oil-sands projects in Alberta, Canada, Exxon understated the costs of future government regulation by $25 billion, the office said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon has said regulation in Alberta \"has been and remains in flux, with rival political factions enacting and repealing climate regulations regularly.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exxon says reasonable investors understood it weighed climate risks while not disclosing proprietary details. It had different ways of calculating regulation risks and applied them in appropriate contexts, its lawyers wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case is divisive partly because it relies on the Martin Act, a broad New York state law that has been employed to pursue Wall Street fraud.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is an abuse of the Martin Act,\" said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, which fights what it views as excessive litigation. \"By all indications, this is a lawsuit to carry out a political agenda.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernie Nash, co-head of the state attorneys general practice at firm Cozen O'Connor P.C., said the case was an atypical use of the Martin Act. In the past, the courts have allowed for broad uses of the Martin Act, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Philosophically, no statute is limitless and you don't know when you've exceeded it until the court says so,\" Mr. Nash said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Corinne Ramey at \nCorinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Corinne Ramey\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

These officials have been purposefully trying to head off the addition of any mandates on manufacturers, refiners, cement-makers and other heavy industries. Others deny that is a preordained goal of the rulemaking, while acknowledging it may still be a likely outcome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of the policy change acknowledge that their effort could be undone if President Trump doesn't win re-election in November. The initiative could also face challenges in court, or from Congress .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since 2007, the EPA has been operating under a Supreme Court ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The EPA produced a subsequent decision in 2009, \"the endangerment finding,\" that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These precedents have been an obstacle to Mr. Trump's push for deregulation. His appointees at the EPA have sought ways to blunt the power of those precedents and block the spread of similar restrictions to other industries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's quite clear they're not good-faith stewards of environmental law,\" said Lauren Pagel, policy director at the advocacy organization Earthworks, which monitors methane leaks at oil and gas operations in states like Texas and New Mexico. \"If they're going to go after the endangerment finding or do some type of workaround, it shows they don't believe science, they don't care about public health and they obviously don't care about the climate crisis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Methane contributes to about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. but is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping the earth's heat, according to estimates used by the EPA. Agency figures show the oil-and-gas industry has long been a leading emitter, even before a drilling boom during the last decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The EPA's ongoing rule change seizes on Clean Air Act language that requires the agency to regulate when it determines an industrial activity \"causes, or contributes significantly to\" dangerous air pollution, according to the draft obtained by the Journal. It says the law's definition of significant is ambiguous, and that the EPA should set formal criteria to define it for both pollutants and their sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This promotes regulatory certainty for stakeholders and consistency in the EPA's identification of which air pollutants to regulate and reduces the risk that air pollutants that do not merit regulation will nevertheless become subject to regulation due to an unduly vague standard,\" the methane rule says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because climate change is a global problem, the EPA could set a test that makes \"significant\" a high bar for any greenhouse gas. Their emissions come from diverse sources all over the world. While the U.S. in total is a leading emitter world-wide, the emissions from any one domestic industrial sector could pale in comparison to global emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agency has been using climate modeling to explore its strategy, one senior administration official said. It shows that limiting emissions from almost any U.S. industrial sector won't change global temperatures from what is expected in 2050, even measuring out to the sixth decimal place, the official added. This person expects no source would pass the test for new regulation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One obstacle for the administration is it has already failed in one attempt to get this type of argument on greenhouse-gas emissions through the courts. A similar claim from the administration drew scorn just weeks ago from a U.S. District Court judge in Northern California, who went on to vacate its attempt to undo a parallel methane policy at the Interior Department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Framing sources as less than 1% of global emissions is dishonest and a prescription for climate disaster,\" wrote Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in a decision highly critical of the administration on several fronts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Timothy Puko\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 5}

But to squeeze a living from it today, she and her husband need to do more than sell the milk from their herd of cows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So they carpeted the roofs of their farm buildings with solar panels. And thanks to hefty government guarantees, what they earn from selling electricity is \u201csafe money, not like cows,\u201d Ms. Zinnecker said. \u201cMilk prices go up and down.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The farm has been a beneficiary of \u201cEnergiewende,\u201d the German word for energy transition. Over the past two decades, Germany has focused its political will and treasure on a world-leading effort to wean its powerful economy off the traditional energy sources blamed for climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits of the program have not been universally felt, however. A de facto class system has emerged, saddling a group of have-nots with higher electricity bills that help subsidize the installation of solar panels and wind turbines elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Germany has spent an estimated 189 billion euros, or about $222 billion, since 2000 on renewable energy subsidies. But emissions have been stuck at roughly 2009 levels, and rose last year, as coal-fired plants fill a void left by Germany\u2019s decision to abandon nuclear power. That has raised questions \u2014 and anger \u2014 over a program meant to make the country\u2019s power sector greener.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This lack of progress is an \u201cillustration of the partial failure of the energy transition,\u201d said Artur Lenkowski, an energy analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm. \u201cThe whole point of the energy transition was to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, Energiewende is at a crossroads. Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term as Germany\u2019s leader after elections last month , but her party lost sway. She must form a coalition with the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Liberals, parties that have diametrically opposing views, including on environmental policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How such a diverse group comes together will affect whether Germany reaches its goal for carbon emissions. It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allg\u00e4u, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker\u2019s family-owned farm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around \u20ac40 million has been invested over the years \u2014 much of it by residents \u2014 into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>G\u00fcnter M\u00f6gele, Wildpoldsried\u2019s deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village\u2019s decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents\u2019 shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These big increases \u201care absolutely not O.K.,\u201d said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The higher prices have had political consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an \u201cimmediate exit\u201d from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a \u201cburden\u201d on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program\u2019s mounting costs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Julian Hermneuw\u00f6hner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuw\u00f6hner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional \u20ac800 a year because of Energiewende.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cBut it hasn\u2019t brought lower CO2 emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019re paying so much more, because the country hasn\u2019t gotten anything for it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that progress has been undone somewhat by the government\u2019s decision to accelerate its phase out of nuclear power after the 2011 disaster in Fukushima, Japan. That has made the country more reliant on its sizable fleet of coal-fired power stations, which account for the bulk of emissions from electricity generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The country has yet to address the transport industry , where emissions have increased as the economy boomed and more cars and trucks hit the road. Unlike Britain and \n France , Germany has not set a date to end \n the sale of diesel and gasoline cars .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent political experience does not bode well for Germany. The so-called grand coalition between Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which governed from 2013 until the recent elections, was bogged down with so many competing interests that it was unable to push ahead on energy policy .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects \u2014 though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cSome of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,\u201d said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIt is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow Stanley Reed on Twitter: @stanleyreed12 .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Saturday with an article about challenges facing Germany\u2019s clean energy industry misspelled the surname of a farmer in Betzigau, Germany, who, with his wife, has installed solar panels on his property.

The Obama administration plans to remedy this situation by drafting rules that would curtail these discharges from existing plants. The president should make sure they are tough. Nothing he can do will cut greenhouse gases more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By accomplishing this under the executive authority Congress granted him in the Clean Air Act, the president will be stepping in where recent Congresses have refused to go. He did the same thing last August, when he toughened auto emissions standards that will result in a new car fleet that averages 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, and again last spring, when he proposed rules, restricting carbon dioxide emissions, that will effectively prevent the building of new coal-burning power plants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now President Obama should require existing power plants to reduce their emissions by at least one-quarter by 2020. These plants emitted 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2011, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, so a 25 percent cut would result in a reduction of more than 500 million tons. This would reduce lung-related illness and premature deaths, slow the accumulation of climate-changing gases in the atmosphere and demonstrate to the rest of the world that the United States was serious about taking on global warming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To achieve these reductions, the rules should favor making homes, buildings and power plants more energy efficient over the more costly conversion of coal-fired plants to natural gas. (Gas-fired power plants emit half as much carbon dioxide as coal-fired plants. But expanding energy efficiency will reduce electricity demand and eliminate the need for the coal plants. Closing them is better than converting them to gas.) The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says the technology exists now to cut electricity use by one-quarter by 2020 through efficiency alone. Based on the average electricity production of the nation\u2019s large coal-fired power plants, this would allow for the closing of close to 60 such plants across the nation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, the coal and utility industries won\u2019t take this lying down. Some coal mines may be closed, and the electric industry will be reconfigured. A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated recently that reducing emissions by at least one-quarter over the next seven years would cost $4 billion in compliance expenses in 2020. But the reduced hospitalizations and fewer days of work lost to illness, and other health and environmental benefits would save $25 billion to $60 billion, the study said. The approach would also stimulate investments of more than $90 billion in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, according to the analysis for the N.R.D.C. by the consulting firm ICF International.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The progression to using less coal will create new jobs to build the highly efficient appliances, wind turbines, solar farms and other technologies that capture renewable energy. In addition, jobs will be created as some states and utilities choose to comply by building natural gas power plants, which should be done only if they won\u2019t cause environmental havoc.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The auto industry is beginning to show how strong emissions standards and the technological advances they stimulate can benefit employment. When the new rules were announced last summer, Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers, predicted that they would require \u201cmore engineers and more factory workers, expanding employment in the industry.\u201d And Ford, which had already doubled its team working on fuel-saving engineering, said it planned to redouble the unit in 2015. Indeed, last week, Ford announced that it was adding 450 jobs at its Brook Park, Ohio, plant to produce its EcoBoost engine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not everyone will benefit immediately, of course. As demand for coal drops, some miners will lose their jobs. The nation owes them economic support, job training and sustainable jobs. There is a precedent for this: the government established a fund to help workers at nuclear weapons plants move to new jobs as the cold war ended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even as we reduce power plant pollution, we will need to do more to protect the atmosphere. We should also reduce emissions of such short-lived contributors to global warming as methane by tightening up leaky natural gas systems, and hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air-conditioning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, we must meet our energy needs largely without coal, oil or gas. We must use energy more efficiently to lower demand to the point that ramped-up clean, renewable energy supplies most of what we require.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By ordering the new auto emissions standards, Mr. Obama took an enormous step in the fight against global warming. In a similarly bold move, he can reduce our reliance on coal, a dirty fuel that is the greatest contributor to the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution. By setting stringent power plant standards, he will slow global warming at a fraction of the cost of ignoring it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel F.

That's because, in its view, most of Alberta's oil will find a way to get to the market anyway -- if not by pipeline, then by rail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the high end, the review concludes, blocking all proposed future pipelines out of Alberta would cut tar sands production 2 to 4 percent and have the same climate impact as taking one million cars off the road by 2030. That's the equivalent of about 0.07 percent of current U.S. emissions. (Other environmental groups have argued that the climate impacts could be six times as large.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, this report is not a final approval of the pipeline. Next up, there's a 45-day public comment period for the environmental review. Then the State Department will have to determine whether the pipeline is in America's national interest. Finally, President Obama has to decide whether to approve it or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, this is a key step in the process. Here are five key points from today's report:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1) Oil from the tar sands produces 17 percent more greenhouse-gas emissions over its life-cycle than regular oil. As such, the State Department points out that the pipeline could increase overall carbon pollution -- if it leads to a major expansion of Canada's tar-sands production. That, in turn, would worsen global warming. So that brings us to the key question</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2) The State Department thinks blocking the Keystone pipeline would have only a small impact on tar-sands production and climate change. If Canada can't find an outlet for its oil, there will be less production. So what happens if Keystone XL gets blocked? A lot depends on whether other pipelines get built, such as a proposed project through British Columbia -- as well as how much oil can be shipped profitably by rail instead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The State Department considered two scenarios. First, if the Keystone pipeline is blocked, and other proposed pipelines go forward, tar sands production in Alberta \"could decrease by approximately 0.4 to 0.6 percent\" by 2030. A fairly small drop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alternatively, if Keystone XL was blocked and all of the proposed pipeline capacity out of Alberta were restricted, then tar sands production would drop by 2 to 4 percent by 2030.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a real dip, albeit a small one. In that second scenario, we would see a decrease of somewhere between 0.07 to 5.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030. At the high end, that would be like taking one million cars off the road. But that's also equivalent to just 0.07 percent of current U.S. emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmentalists, for their part, are hotly disputing this section of the review, arguing that blocking Keystone would deal a much bigger, crippling blow to the tar sands. \"Canadian tar sands exports are blocked to the west by tribes that won't sell out their natural resources to Big Oil, and blocked to the east by the European Union's declaration that it won't buy dirty tar sands oil,\" said Jim Lyon of the National Wildlife Federation. \"Without access to major U.S. export terminals from Keystone XL and other routes, tar sands production will be substantially slowed.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3) If the Keystone XL pipeline is blocked, rail transport could make up most of the difference. \"Rail and supporting non-pipeline modes should be capable of providing the capacity needed to transport all incremental Western Canadian and Bakken crude oil production to markets if there were no additional pipeline projects approved.\" Elsewhere, Robert Bryce has explained how rail companies will deliver oil if the pipeline gets blocked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4) A pipeline spill is \"very unlikely\" to affect the key Ogallala Aquifer. The Ogallala Aquifer in the Midwest is one of the key freshwater sources for the Great Plains. So there's plenty of justifiable worry about running the Keystone pipeline through this area, given the potential for leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the State Department's not overly concerned about this: \"Overall, it is very unlikely that the proposed pipeline area would affect water quality in the [Great Plains Area] due to weak downward gradients (downward groundwater flows) in the aquifers overlying the [Great Plains Area].\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5) The Keystone XL project, if built, would support 42,000 jobs over its two-year construction period. \"Including direct, indirect, and induced effects, the proposed Project would potentially support approximately 42,100 average annual jobs across the United States over a 1-to 2-year construction period (of which, approximately 3,900 would be directly employed in construction activities).\" As with all construction projects, these jobs would be temporary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related:Just how dirty are Canada's oil sands, anyway?\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 4}

The effects of climate change are happening much faster than many of us expected.

Instead, the nation seems more divided and in conflict than it has been in decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2014, the National Capital Planning Commission released a report outlining the challenges posed by climate change. Cooperation is the key.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The neighborhoods of the Washington, DC region are at risk of losing their strength and vitality due to changes in climate that may cause serious disruptions to public transportation, flood homes and parks, and reduce the economic vigor of the area,\" the report said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To meet the challenges, we'll need strong social networks. Transportation infrastructure needs strengthening. Metrorail has got to be more reliable. We need more trees. Better ways to collect rainwater, like rooftop gardens. We need solar power instead of being so reliant on outdated electrical grids.

Warnings that climate change could cause food and water shortages drove others to stockpile those basics in addition to the guns and ammunition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In February, Daniel Coats, then director of national intelligence under President Trump, echoed the Obama administration warnings during testimony before a Senate subcommittee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security,\" Coats said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's response?

Its plant life constantly absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and returns oxygen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But deforestation and climate change may soon lead to a permanent change in the region\u2019s climate, scientists warn. The rainforest would be eroded past the point at which it can produce enough rainfall to sustain itself. More forest would die out, further reducing rainfall, in a self-reinforcing feedback loop of self-destruction that, once begun, might not be possible to stop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before long, much of the world\u2019s largest rainforest could disappear, receding into a vast savanna.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would be a terrible loss in its own right, stripping the world of much of its biodiversity, and more broadly, a climate disaster without an equivalent in world history. The region would cease to absorb climate-warming carbon dioxide and, in the process, release up to six times the annual carbon output of every coal-burning plant on earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I first wrote about dieback, as this phenomenon is known, in 2019. That year, Thomas Lovejoy, a prominent environmental scientist, told me the scenario was \u201cclose. It\u2019s really close.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He added, \u201cAnd it can happen in a very short period of time.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two years later, a series of alarming events and scientific findings suggest that the warnings may soon, or even now, be coming to pass.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIf you look at the current weather patterns,\u201d Dr. Lovejoy told me this week, \u201cit looks to me like the tipping point is here and now.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How does dieback happen?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scientists began to document the process in the 2010s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In one experiment, researchers found that if they subjected a plot of rainforest to small fires over several years, and if rainfall also declined, then something snapped. The proportion of plant life that died after a single fire spiked from about 5 to 60 percent \u2014 ecological death.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fires, it turned out, had burned out much of the dense forest floor, which normally acts as a break on fire. Invasive grasses filled in, providing fuel for future fires. Fires also thinned the trees, allowing future fires to burn faster and hotter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a drop in rainfall was the crucial ingredient. It slowed regrowth, keeping the plot sparse. And it dried out those invasive grasses, turning the forest floor into a layer of fast-burning kindling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Years of development in the Amazon have effectively reproduced this experiment on an enormous scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fires, many set deliberately to convert rainforest into farmland, have thinned much of the rainforest, while also allowing invasive grasses to rush in. Roads and other construction have also bifurcated the rainforest, thinning it out and exposing forest edges that dry easily and make for especially potent firespreaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this happens in a large enough area, it can severely reduce rainfall \u2014 creating the conditions that led to sudden ecological death in the fire study.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Normally, plant life absorbs rainwater and groundwater, then sweats it back out into the atmosphere as moisture, seeding more rain. Less forest means less rain. Possibly a lot less.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change exacerbates every part of this cycle. It is shortening the rainy season and raising temperatures. Forests are drier and thinner. The tipping point, past which the rainforest can no longer produce enough rain to keep itself healthy, is much easier to reach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This process can take on a momentum all its own. And it is thought to naturally spread. As one area experiences dieback, neighboring rainforest becomes more exposed while also seeing rainfall drop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe models, and they\u2019re pretty consistent,\u201d Dr. Lovejoy said in 2019, \u201csuggest that the combination of fire and climate change and deforestation will weaken the hydrological cycle of the Amazon to the point where you just get insufficient rainfall in the south and the east, and then part of the central Amazon, to actually support a rainforest.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is dieback happening now?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the last two years, Dr. Lovejoy said, signs of this process have accumulated. Rainfall is down, he said, and temperatures are rising.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He cited a 20 percent drop in corn production as a particularly worrying indicator. Past research has identified corn as especially sensitive to environmental changes from deforestation and climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Amazon deforestation has been accelerating, indicating that there may be more than fires at work. Last year, the rate of deforestation increased 12 percent from 2019, which was already a catastrophic year for the Amazon. And it may be increasing further. Brazilian government figures show record rates of month-by-month deforestation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even more worrying, parts of the Amazon have already flipped from net absorbers of carbon dioxide to net emitters, according to research released last month. It is an indicator that the process may already be beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What does it mean for the world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The potential loss of the Amazon rainforest would provide not one but two of the greatest accelerants to climate change since the industrial revolution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, it would significantly reduce the rate at which the earth naturally converts carbon dioxide back into oxygen. It would be as if the amount of carbon produced by factories and cars suddenly shot up worldwide, simply because there was less to counterbalance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, the process of deforestation itself deposits shocking amounts of carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rainforest is estimated to store about 100 billion tons of carbon as plant matter. When that matter burns, the carbon gets released into the atmosphere. That\u2019s nearly seven times the amount of carbon emitted by every coal plant worldwide in 2017.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Replacing much of the Amazon rainforest with a hot, dry savanna would also devastate one of the world\u2019s largest centers of unique plant and animal species as well as many Indigenous communities. The knock-on ecological effects are hard to anticipate, but nobody thinks they would be good \u2014 or limited to South America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency situation,\u201d Adriane Esquivel Muelbert, a University of Birmingham ecologist, told the scientific journal Nature last year. \u201cWe can fix this, but we need to act now.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel Nepstad, an environmental scientist who studies the Amazon, told me this week, \u201cI am worried by fatalistic responses to these new discoveries \u2014 the sense of resignation that there is nothing we can do to manage the forest dieback. There is actually a lot that we can do.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He added: \u201cAmazon forests are tenacious. Give them a chance \u2014 protect them from fire \u2014 and they come charging back.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Dr. Lovejoy and others, the answer is difficult but obvious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cTime to act,\u201d he said, defining that action with one word: \u201cReforest.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What We\u2019re Reading</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cDemocracy and the Market,\u201d the seminal and still-relevant 1991 book on how modern democracy comes about and survives (or doesn\u2019t), by the scholar Adam Przeworski.

Suggs, an activist and University of North Carolina sophomore from eastern North Carolina, and Lindsay Cooper, a recent college graduate and policy analyst for Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who are both from regions recently pelted with intense hurricanes and subsequent flooding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They also include Aji Piper, one of 21 plaintiffs, now ages 10 to 21, in a\u00a0high-profile case against the federal government for allegedly violating their constitutional rights by promoting fossil fuels and forcing them later in life to live in a warming world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Like youth who have come before us in the civil rights movement and other social justice movements,\"\u00a0Piper told lawmakers, \"it is often the young among us that shine the light on systems of injustice.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats held the hearing as lawmakers are preparing for the 2020 election. Turnout among young people will be key to Democrats' chances of retaking the White House or Senate, and retaining the House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also comes as students across dozens of U.S. states last month skipped school to protest inaction in addressing the causes or effects of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hearing, however, did not bring clarity to\u00a0what the sort of proposals the\u00a0climate committee will produce going forward. Castor has not announced the topic of the next hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, in an indication of how Democrats want to double down on the climate issue even after the recent\u00a0defeat of the Green New Deal in the Senate, Castor\u00a0said her committee will hold field hearings outside Washington in the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike other environmental committees in the House, such as the Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources panels, the committee on the climate crisis is purely fact-finding. The other committees deal with actual legislation. This\u00a0year, other committees have held more than a dozen hearings on various facets of climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, one of Castor's own bills \u2014 to prevent the United States from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord \u2014 was advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Republicans accused Democrats of ramming through that legislation, formally introduced just at the end of March,\u00a0without any hearings despite promises from Democrats to return to regular order.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The committee did not hold a single hearing on the details and effect of the legislation,\" Rep. Greg Walden (Ore.), top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said during a hearing. \"Stakeholders have not had the ability to weigh in on the impacts of this bill.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), a high-ranking\u00a0Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel, countered that Castor's bill committing the country to the Paris agreement was a \"straightforward issue.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There was a push to move forward aggressively because we lost 10 years,\" he added in an interview Thursday. \"We lost a lot of time.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, at least some Republicans, who collectively have\u00a0been reluctant or outright hostile to having discussions about climate change in the past, have been more open this Congress to addressing the issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That shift was on display at Thursday's hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have an opportunity to make progress on this issue,\" said the top Republican on the select climate panel, Garret Graves (La.), while emphasizing the loss of coastline in his state and his desire for \"logical solutions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 David Bernhardt's nomination approved by Senate panel: The former energy and water\u00a0lobbyist is one step closer to becoming Interior secretary. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 14 to 6 to approve Bernhardt's nomination on Thursday, with several Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), joining the 11 Republican members voting to make him the permanent leader of the department.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Bernhardt's ability to manage those resources without bias toward the oil industry and water utilities he once represented was questioned by skeptical Democrats on the committee as well as conservationists,\" The Post's Darryl Fears reports, adding that the Thursday vote \"reflected little of the contentious questioning of Bernhardt during a confirmation hearing the week before.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Another request for another investigation into Bernhardt:\u00a0Just before the vote, a group of eight Senate Democrats\u00a0called\u00a0on Interior's internal watchdog to investigate Bernhardt's role in blocking the release of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analysis on pesticides and endangered species. It's the second such letter Senate Democrats have sent to the\u00a0inspector general's office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Another Iowa Republican chimes in on\u00a0Trump's wind turbine remarks:\u00a0Sen. Joni Ernst called\u00a0the president's remarks this week that noise from wind turbines cause cancer\u00a0\"ridiculous.\" She continued: \"I have church bells that ring all the time across from my office here in D.C. and I know that noise doesn't give me cancer, otherwise I'd have 'church bell cancer,'\" Ernst said,\u00a0according\u00a0to Iowa's WHO TV. Ernst called wind energy a \"tremendous asset\" for her state. The state's other senator,\u00a0Charles E. Grassley (R), similarly called Trump's remarks \"idiotic.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Interior reverses effort limit oil and gas development in Montana: After a federal court ruled to reinstate drilling leases on public land bordering Glacier National Park that had been canceled by the Interior Department in 2016 and 2017, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a Montana native, had planned to appeal the rulings. But the department this week filed\u00a0an intent to withdraw its appeal of one case, the Missoulian reports. It is an indication of an end to the relative cautiousness at Interior of developing Montana while it was being run by Zinke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 NOAA plan would let Washington tribe hunt gray whales again: A new proposal from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would grant the Makah tribe in the state of Washington the ability to resume hunting gray whales. The tribe last legally hunted gray whales in 1999. \"But subsequent hunts were mired in lawsuits and administrative procedures,\" the Seattle Times reports. \"Further controversy erupted after five Makah tribal members illegally hunted and killed a gray whale on Sept. 8, 2007.\" NOAA's proposal includes a limited 10-year hunting waiver and would require the tribe to get a permit from the agency before any hunt. The proposal would also limit the tribe to killing no more than three whales per year in even numbered years and one whale per year in odd-numbered ones.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2014 Expect an \"average\" hurricane season: The Colorado State University's hurricane research team has released its initial predictions for the upcoming season.

No U.S.-only initiative can stop the planet from warming. Any effective response to climate change will require broad, international effort.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All true. But such coordination is not as out of reach as many believe. It is quite possible -- if the United States does its part.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The European Union has been shrinking its carbon footprint for years, proof that the United States will not be cutting emissions alone. A 2013 study of 33 major nations found a broad move toward environmental protection in places such as Japan, Mexico and South Korea. Developed nations alone can have a noticeable effect: A Council of Economic Advisers study last month noted that the climate-change response will be a lot less expensive if developed countries start now and others catch up than if no one starts now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But large developing countries can and should be expected to act, too. At the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, China agreed to moderate but serious reductions in its economy's carbon intensity -- how much carbon dioxide it produces for every unit of gross domestic product -- a result possible only because President Obama brought a carbon-cutting pledge to the table. If countries merely sustain their Copenhagen commitments, that alone will bend the global emissions curve down, a 2013 MIT analysis found.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since Copenhagen, China has offered a mixed picture, not confirmation that it will do nothing. The country has built coal-fired plants, but its rulers are also investing in nuclear power, experimenting with carbon pricing and emphasizing environmental considerations with increasing urgency. The government has little choice; air quality in the north has become a noxious social problem, and China faces a variety of climate risks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next year, international negotiators will meet in Paris. They will bring their national contributions, already vetted at home, to the conference and bundle them together. This system may not drive down emissions as quickly as the top-down treaty of activists' dreams. But it is achievable, and the pledges will be more reliable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experts at MIT and elsewhere anticipate that some countries, such as India and South Africa, will bring little to the table but that China will expand on its previous commitments. Added to others' pledges, backed by efforts already underway, this would move the global emissions curve down more, heading off catastrophic high-emissions scenarios. Even so, the emissions trajectory would still be above the path scientists recommend to keep global temperature rise moderate. In other words, sustained, contentious diplomatic effort will be required after Paris. The United States must be a driver; no country has pumped more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, and no global effort will succeed without U.S. buy-in and leadership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In trade agreements, other environmental accords and arms-reduction pacts, countries have shown they can overcome mutual suspicion when cooperation offers clear, long-term benefits. A U.S. commitment would offer other countries confidence that the United States will jump with them -- and allow U.S. diplomats to isolate laggards. Congress can help: Putting a price on U.S. carbon emissions, and applying a charge on imports from countries without a strong anti-emissions policy, would give China and others an incentive to implement plans of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world will not give up fossil fuels tomorrow -- or many years from tomorrow. The transition scientists recommend will be slow, and the world may have to adapt to risks it did not have enough sense to avoid. But pointing out the difficulty of the problem is not a strategy. It is an excuse to shrink from one of history's greatest challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 3}

But that's the unfortunate position that our financial system is in as it faces increasing challenges from climate change. It's time for the financial system to wake up to the threat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the most politically polarized issue, climate change rarely finds total agreement. So many were likely surprised recently when representatives of oil companies, agribusinesses, banks, retirement funds and environmental organizations, plus some academics like me, jointly authored and unanimously endorsed a government report calling out the risks of climate change to the U.S. financial system. Working together for the top U.S. regulatory agency for derivatives, we wrote that climate change poses an important threat, and the financial system needs to get ready. And we provided dozens of recommendations for what can be done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a lot to fix. For one thing, our government needs to limit the scale of the problem going forward. Dumping climate pollution into the atmosphere is currently free. There needs to be a cost of disrupting our climate. Our legislators need to put a price on carbon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, our government regulators need to be aware of and prioritize the climate-related risks to the financial system. These risks need to be better quantified, and more transparent to investors, so they can be priced appropriately.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate change poses a variety of threats related to commodities like crops and fossil fuels, as well as to real estate and other economic sectors. In the Midwest, we regularly see crops ruined by droughts or floods. We expect wetter springs, bigger downpours and more variable precipitation during hotter summers to crash yields more often. The agricultural banks that many farmers depend on for credit are typically small and disproportionately exposed to these regional extreme weather events. If droughts and floods that threaten farmers' livelihoods also degrade their banks' ability to provide credit, recovery from these events will be even more difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recently, climate-related threats to homes and properties have become painfully obvious on our coasts. In the West, wildfires have grown in size, with terrible consequences. In the East and South, more powerful and wetter hurricanes, pushing storm surges on top of a higher ocean and gulf, have flooded and torn apart homes and businesses. The insurance sector is already reacting to these changing threats; its regulators need to help companies assess their exposure in a transparent and comparable manner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The primary climate risk to the oil, gas and coal industries is that society will take our advice and add the full cost of climatic disruption to the price of fossil fuels. Such a price increase would incentivize companies and individuals to use less of these fuels. A reduction in demand would depress the values of fossil fuels, their discovered but untapped reserves, and the companies that participate in this sector. This risk needs to be clearly quantified for investors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's relatively easy to see how individual events such as floods or fires can affect individual commodities, sectors or even a region. However, the financial system must see how ongoing changes can connect through the market to more broadly threaten its ability to function. For instance, sea-level rise could reduce coastal home values, reducing cities' tax bases and their capacity to make payments on municipal bonds (which may have paid for flood control measures to begin with). Bond defaults are a threat that we want our financial system to manage. But how can it do this if it doesn't see the problem coming?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The risks related to climate change need to be clear to those who put money in the game. Investors, whether they are buying crop futures, municipal bonds, corporate debt or stock in insurance or energy companies, must be able to evaluate their climate risk exposure. We need a commonly accepted level of climate risk that requires disclosure, and straightforward, comparable and fair methods for companies to determine this risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The system needs to be prepared for times when everything goes wrong at once. Aren't we learning this from 2020? Climate disruption increases the chance that the many different weather-related threats will get bigger, happen more often and happen at the same time. Each event is a disaster for many people, and a minor challenge to the financial system. But more and more often, economically damaging events will pile up on top of one another.

A breeze came off the North Saskatchewan River, rippling across rows of ripe wheat, but a caustic scent flooded his nose. An oil well between his crops and the river was leaking, and enough gas was flowing out of a pipe below the rusty pump jack that the farmer could smell gas and see it swirling in the air.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The site had been drilled in 1950 but hadn\u2019t run since 2015. It was now spewing a blend of toxic, egg-smelling hydrogen sulfide and, quite likely, a much larger dose of odorless, flammable methane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThey said, \u2018don\u2019t get too close to it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Romaniuk said, referring to the owners of the well. He put the tractor in gear and skirted the edge of the site, hoping he wouldn\u2019t spark an explosion as he hurried to harvest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada has committed to reducing its planet-warming carbon emissions and has singled out the oil and gas industry as the source of almost half of the country\u2019s annual emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that can have 80 times the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide over 20 years. Alberta, the heart of Canadian hydrocarbon extraction, has set a goal of a 45 percent drop in the industry\u2019s methane footprint from active infrastructure by 2025. But the inactive wells \u2014 the ones no longer producing oil or natural gas but many still lingering in suspension like zombies \u2014 may be as big a threat to the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After decades of booms and busts, an enormous backlog of these inactive wells has built up, and it grows about 6 percent each year. There are now 97,920 wells, like the one on Mr. Romaniuk\u2019s land, that are licensed as temporarily suspended, compared to the province\u2019s 160,000 active wells. The inactive wells are unlikely to be switched on ever again but have not yet been decommissioned. No one knows how many are leaking methane and other pollutants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s been festering for decades,\u201d said Sonya Savage, Alberta\u2019s energy minister.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Alberta, the amount of methane and other potent greenhouse gases seeping from suspended wells has not been comprehensively studied. But research in British Columbia, another province with a long history of oil and gas development, revealed that more than a quarter of inactive wells in that province were leaking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The normal life cycle of an oil or gas well is a little like that of a human: It is brought into life with expectation, produces vibrantly for a time, steadily declines and then is buried under clean soil.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alberta\u2019s oil boom started in earnest in the 1940s. The province was dotted with wells in the following decades, generating billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the price of oil crashed in the 1980s, thousands of wells quickly became unprofitable, and even though Alberta law places responsibility for closing those wells on the industry, many companies stopped taking care of the inactive wells. By 1990, there were more than 29,000 inactive wells in Alberta.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Alberta Energy Regulator, part of the Ministry of Energy, reacted in 1997 with a rule that required companies to close a well after ten years of inactivity. But the industry pushed back and, in 2000, the agency allowed wells to be indefinitely suspended instead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Depending on a well\u2019s concentration of hydrogen sulfide, its condition and its proximity to homes, suspension can be as simple as putting a chain on the valve handles or as complicated as installing a cast iron and rubber bridge plug deep in the ground. Once a well is suspended for longer than 10 years, the plug becomes mandatory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Alberta, unlike in other oil fields including British Columbia and North Dakota, there is no time limit on how long a well can be suspended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly 30,000 wells in Alberta that have been suspended for longer than ten years. According to the Alberta Energy Regulator, these wells are reactivated less than 0.2 percent of the time. One well near Calgary has been suspended since 1928.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>William Morin, chief of the Enoch Cree Nation, drove past a grove where medicine men sometimes harvest sweetgrass, berries and buffalo sage on his way to survey an empty oil tank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWhen oil and gas was produced in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, that\u2019s how this nation grew in capacity and off of government funding,\u201d Mr. Morin said, referring to the Enoch Cree Nation. \u201cBut then the oil and gas ran out.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Out of 274 wells on Enoch Cree land, only 34 are currently pumping. The others are inactive: 43 are suspended and the rest have been decommissioned with a plug and a cement cap, but in many cases, equipment and waste has been left behind. The Enoch Cree Nation is in the process of measuring gas emissions from inactive sites and plans to use an infrared camera to detect hidden flows. But not all leaks are hidden.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One suspended well, set in the woods only a few hundred feet from a home, was wafting the telltale rotten smell of hydrogen sulfide.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, MAGA Energy, a new company, acquired the well when it purchased Cedar Creek Energy, a company with a tangled history that had been passed between several different owners. \u201cWe\u2019re at the tail end of the life on a lot of these properties,\u201d said Mark Ross, a vice president at the company, which has 20 employees and stands for \u201cMake Alberta Great Again.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Half of the wells are suspended, though the company hopes to make some active again by drilling horizontally into new production zones. They have started to close some suspended wells that have no chance of new production, but the price is high. Exactly how high is under debate, but most estimates dwarf the annual taxes and lease payments to leave a well in suspension even for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at 100,000 dollars expenditure for cleanup but the surface leases and the taxes in the meantime might be 3,000 dollars or 3,500 dollars,\u201d Mr. Ross said. (100,000 Canadian dollars is about $75,000.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This spring, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a 1.7 billion Canadian dollar fund to clean up inactive wells around the country as part of a coronavirus stimulus package for the oil and gas industry. Alberta\u2019s share of the program was the bulk: 1.2 billion dollars. So far, applications have been accepted to close 8,200 wells. But this still leaves more than 88,000 suspended wells.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as these wells age, the risk that they leak increases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wells plunge thousands of feet into the earth, with a concrete casing and steel piping that is meant to keep them isolated from the various layers of soil, rock and water that they pass through. But over time, all wells can erode, vulnerable to salty water, corrosive gas, earthquakes and other environmental changes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is little research on emissions from suspended wells in Alberta, and they are not included in a new methane monitoring program for active wells that started in January. Companies are supposed to measure leaks when they find them in suspended wells.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In neighboring British Columbia, 29 percent of inactive wells were leaking when John Werring, a science and policy adviser at the David Suzuki Foundation, an environmental organization, studied them in 2015. And even wells that have been sealed and decommissioned can leak: Between 2009 and 2014, the Alberta Energy Regulator measured leaks in 7.7 percent of wells that were already closed and sealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Savage, the Alberta energy minister, announced a policy in July to clean up suspended wells by requiring companies to spend 4 percent of their estimated cleanup costs per year on well closures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She mentioned that some companies were already meeting the spending requirement voluntarily.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But \u201csome are spending zero,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the ones where we do need to get their inventory cleaned up.\u201d However, she said, \u201cthose are the same companies that are hanging by, month to month, not sure if they can pay their electricity bills.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither Ms. Savage nor the Alberta Energy Regulator has a plan to ensure compliance from these companies, nor have they included timelines in the policy. Instead, the policy\u2019s environmental assessment builds on an existing process for landowners to register complaints about wells on their property. This may give farmers more of a voice but it also relies on citizens to police oil and gas companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is an injustice in enforcing regulations,\u201d said Karl Zajes, as he sat on his porch in the town of Warburg, looking out on his cattle. \u201cIf there was not, there would not be all these inactive wells.\u201d For 30 years, Mr. Zajes has been the president of the Warburg Pembina Surface Rights Group, representing landowners who face battles with the oil and gas industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A farmer may own his fields, but not what\u2019s beneath them. When an oil company acquires the mineral rights, the farmer must allow the company to drill through the property. In exchange, the company will produce a lease document that lays out annual compensation for the farmer for the loss of productivity on the land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s made for them, by them,\u201d Mr. Zajes said of the fossil fuel industry. The landowners are typically farmers, not lawyers, and so Mr. Zajes helps them navigate the lease process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The leak in the well on Mr. Romaniuk\u2019s land is not the first problem to crop up on the property. He fought for lease payments after one company went bankrupt and, a decade ago, his fields were exposed to a different gas leak.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt was a terrible smell,\u201d Mr. Romaniuk said. \u201cI was worried that my cattle might asphyxiate,\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAll gas wells vent,\u201d said Noreen Sumara, the health, safety and environment manager at Long Run Energy, the company that owns the well. She said that the new leak did not pose an environmental or human risk. \u201cWe\u2019re following all regulations,\u201d Ms. Sumara said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current flow from the rusty pump jack on Mr. Romaniuk\u2019s land is not included in the Alberta Energy Regulator database, which is self-reported by the companies. The well sits in the field, at the end of its life yet still uncapped and unburied, leaking.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 6}

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that continued greenhouse gas emissions \"would cause further warming\" and induce changes that could \"occur in all regions of the globe . . . and include changes in land and ocean, in the water cycle, in the cryosphere, in sea level . . . and in ocean acidification.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six years ago, in its last report, the IPCC concluded that there was a 90 percent certainty that human activity was responsible for most of Earth's warming. The 2013 draft summary increased that certainty to 95 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global surface temperature from 1951-2010,\" the report said. \"There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level, and changed some climate extremes, in the second half of the 20th century.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The IPCC -- composed of hundreds of scientists, including from federal agencies -- tracks the impact of global warming on specific regions and species and won a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with former vice president Al Gore. The body plans to release its massive final report in four stages over the next year, starting with a meeting next month in Stockholm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The draft summary, completed in June, was leaked and first reported last weekend by the Reuters news service and later by the New York Times. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the draft Tuesday afternoon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In remarks to the British Broadcasting Corp., a spokesman said that the report is far from complete and that conclusions should not be drawn from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It is guaranteed it will change,\" said Jonathan Lynn, spokesman for the IPCC. He said the document was provided to U.N. member governments and has drawn 1,800 comments, many of which will be considered as the assessment is debated and edited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the leaked draft mirrors previous assessments in many ways, and asserts that its changed predictions are the result of significant improvements in the way scientists study the rise in temperature and sea levels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some say the draft's predictions are too conservative. The prediction that ocean levels could rise as much as three feet by the end of the century conflicts with those of other scientists who envision even more dire consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A report on Maryland sea-level rise released in June by the state'sClimate Change Commission estimated that the rise would range from slightly less than a foot to two feet by 2050, and from two to six feet by 2100, depending on several factors, including glacial ice melt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Up to six feet of sea-level rise can be devastating when effects from storm surge are factored in, said Donald F. Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to projections, the document reported several facts. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by more than 20 percent since 1958 and 40 percent since 1750, \"virtually all due to burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, and a small contribution from cement production.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, climate change will continue for centuries even if emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. \"This represents a substantial multi-century commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, called the draft a sober snapshot of how climate science has evolved since the last report.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Scientists have a clearer picture of how our climate is changing,\" she said. The bad news: \"The problem is getting worse because countries keep dumping more heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ekwurzel said this draft has a more realistic estimate for global sea-level rise than the last report. Still, scientists are estimating a far more rapid sea-level rise \"for planners in places like the East Coast.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>darryl.fears@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 7}

In the aftermath, her husband died and she became so destitute that she sold her son and daughter into bonded servitude. And she may lose yet more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Khatun now lives in a bamboo shack that sits below sea level about 50 yards from a sagging berm. She spends her days collecting cow dung for fuel and struggling to grow vegetables in soil poisoned by salt water. Climate scientists predict that this area will be inundated as sea levels rise and storm surges increase, and a cyclone or another disaster could easily wipe away her rebuilt life. But Ms. Khatun is trying to hold out at least for a while \u2014 one of millions living on borrowed time in this vast landscape of river islands, bamboo huts, heartbreaking choices and impossible hopes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the world\u2019s top scientists meet in Yokohama, Japan, this week, at the top of the agenda is the prediction that global sea levels could rise more than three feet by 2100. Higher seas and warmer weather will cause profound changes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Climate scientists have concluded that widespread burning of fossil fuels is releasing heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet. While this will produce a host of effects, the most worrisome may be the melting of much of the earth\u2019s ice, which is likely to raise sea levels and flood coastal regions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such a rise will be uneven because of gravitational effects and human intervention, so predicting its outcome in any one place is difficult. But island nations like the Maldives, Kiribati and Fiji may lose much of their land area, and millions of Bangladeshis will be displaced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere are a lot of places in the world at risk from rising sea levels, but Bangladesh is at the top of everybody\u2019s list,\u201d said Rafael Reuveny, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University at Bloomington. \u201cAnd the world is not ready to cope with the problems.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The effects of climate change have led to a growing sense of outrage in developing nations, many of which have contributed little to the pollution that is linked to rising temperatures and sea levels but will suffer the most from the consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At a climate conference in Warsaw in November, there was an emotional outpouring from countries that face existential threats, among them Bangladesh, which produces just 0.3 percent of the emissions driving climate change. Some leaders have demanded that rich countries compensate poor countries for polluting the atmosphere. A few have even said that developed countries should open their borders to climate migrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of global justice,\u201d said Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies and the nation\u2019s leading climate scientist. \u201cThese migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>River deltas around the globe are particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising seas, and wealthier cities like London, Venice and New Orleans also face uncertain futures. But it is the poorest countries with the biggest populations that will be hit hardest, and none more so than Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated nations in the world. In the Ganges Delta, made up of 230 major rivers and streams, 160 million people live in a place one-fifth the size of France and as flat as chapati, the bread served at almost every meal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Perilous Position</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Bangladesh has contributed little to industrial air pollution, other kinds of environmental degradation have left it especially vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bangladesh relies almost entirely on groundwater for drinking supplies because the rivers are so polluted. The resultant pumping causes the land to settle. So as sea levels are rising, Bangladesh\u2019s cities are sinking, increasing the risks of flooding. Poorly constructed seawalls compound the problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The country\u2019s climate scientists and politicians have come to agree that by 2050, rising sea levels will inundate some 17 percent of the land and displace about 18 million people, Dr. Rahman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bangladeshis have already started to move away from the lowest-lying villages in the river deltas of the Bay of Bengal, scientists in Bangladesh say. People move for many reasons, and urbanization is increasing across South Asia, but rising tides are a big factor. Dr. Rahman\u2019s research group has made a rough estimate from small surveys that as many as 1.5 million of the five million slum inhabitants in Dhaka, the capital, moved from villages near the Bay of Bengal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The slums that greet them in Dhaka are also built on low-lying land, making them almost as vulnerable to being inundated as the land villagers left behind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Khatun and her neighbors have lived through deadly cyclones \u2014 a synonym here for hurricane \u2014 and have seen the salty rivers chew through villages and poison fields. Rising seas are increasingly intruding into rivers, turning fresh water brackish. Even routine flooding then leaves behind salt deposits that can render land barren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making matters worse, much of what the Bangladeshi government is doing to stave off the coming deluge \u2014 raising levees, dredging canals, pumping water \u2014 deepens the threat of inundation in the long term, said John Pethick, a former professor of coastal science at Newcastle University in England who has spent much of his retirement studying Bangladesh\u2019s predicament. Rich nations are not the only ones to blame, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an analysis of decades of tidal records published in October, Dr. Pethick found that high tides in Bangladesh were rising 10 times faster than the global average. He predicted that seas in Bangladesh could rise as much as 13 feet by 2100, four times the global average. In an area where land is often a thin brown line between sky and river \u2014 nearly a quarter of Bangladesh is less than seven feet above sea level \u2014 such an increase would have dire consequences, Dr. Pethick said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe reaction among Bangladeshi government officials has been to tell me that I must be wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable, but it also means they have no hope of preparing themselves.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Rahman said that he did not disagree with Dr. Pethick\u2019s findings, but that no estimate was definitive. Other scientists have predicted more modest rises. For example, Robert E. Kopp, an associate director of the Rutgers Energy Institute at Rutgers University, said that data from nearby Kolkata, India, suggested that seas in the region could rise five to six feet by 2100.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThere is no doubt that preparations within Bangladesh have been utterly inadequate, but any such preparations are bound to fail because the problem is far too big for any single government,\u201d said Tariq A. Karim, Bangladesh\u2019s ambassador to India. \u201cWe need a regional and, better yet, a global solution. And if we don\u2019t get one soon, the Bangladeshi people will soon become the world\u2019s problem, because we will not be able to keep them.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Karim estimated that as many as 50 million Bangladeshis would flee the country by 2050 if sea levels rose as expected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Losing Everything</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already, signs of erosion are everywhere in the Ganges Delta \u2014 the world\u2019s largest delta, which empties much of the water coming from the Himalayas. There are brick foundations torn in half, palm trees growing out of rivers and rangy cattle grazing on island pastures the size of putting greens. Fields are dusted white with salt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even without climate change, Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable places in the world to bad weather: The V-shaped Bay of Bengal funnels cyclones straight into the country\u2019s fan-shaped coastline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some scientists believe that rising temperatures will lead to more extreme weather worldwide, including stronger and more frequent cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. And rising seas will make any storm more dangerous because flooding will become more likely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bangladesh has done much to protect its population by creating an early-warning system and building at least 2,500 concrete storm shelters. The result has been a vast reduction in storm-related deaths. While Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed as many as 550,000 people, Cyclone Aila in 2009 killed 300. The deadliest part of the storm was the nearly 10-foot wall of water that roared through villages in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The poverty of people like Ms. Khatun makes them particularly vulnerable to storms. When Aila hit, Ms. Khatun was home with her husband, parents and four children. A nearby berm collapsed, and their mud and bamboo hut washed away in minutes. Unable to save her belongings, Ms. Khatun put her youngest child on her back and, with her husband, fought through surging waters to a high road. Her parents were swept away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAfter about a kilometer, I managed to grab a tree,\u201d said Abddus Satter, Ms. Khatun\u2019s father. \u201cAnd I was able to help my wife grab on as well. We stayed on that tree for hours.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The couple eventually shifted to the roof of a nearby hut. The family reunited on the road the next day after the children spent a harrowing night avoiding snakes that had sought higher ground, too. They drank rainwater until rescuers arrived a day or two later with bottled water, food and other supplies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ordeal took a severe toll on Ms. Khatun\u2019s husband, whose health soon deteriorated. To pay for his treatment and the cost of rebuilding their hut, the family borrowed money from a loan shark. In return, Ms. Khatun and her three older children, then 10, 12 and 15, promised to work for seven months in a nearby brickmaking factory. She later sold her 11- and 13-year-old children to the owner of another brick factory, this one in Dhaka, for $450 to pay more debts. Her husband died four years after the storm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an interview, one of her sons, Mamun Sardar, now 14, said he worked from dawn to dusk carrying newly made bricks to the factory oven.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said he missed his mother, \u201cbut she lives far away.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Impossible Hopes</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Discussions about the effects of climate change in the Ganges Delta often become community events. In the village of Choto Jaliakhali, where Ms. Khatun lives, dozens of people said they could see that the river was rising. Several said they had been impoverished by erosion, which has cost many villagers their land.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Muhammad Moktar Ali said he could not think about the next storm because all he had in the world was his hut and village. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to support ourselves if we lost this,\u201d he said, gesturing to his gathered neighbors. \u201cIt is God who will help us survive.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Surveys show that residents of the delta do not want to migrate, Dr. Rahman said. Moving to slums in already crowded cities is their least preferred option.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But cities have become the center of Bangladesh\u2019s textile industry, which is now the source of 80 percent of the country\u2019s exports, 45 percent of its industrial employment and 15 percent of its gross domestic product.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the weeks after the storm, the women of Dakope found firewood by wading into the raging river and pushing their toes into the muddy bottom. They walked hours to buy drinking water. After rebuilding the village\u2019s berm and their own hut, Shirin Aktar and her husband, Bablu Gazi, managed to get just enough of a harvest to survive from their land, which has become increasingly infertile from salt water. Some plots that once sustained three harvests can now support just one; others are entirely barren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After two hungry years, the couple gave up on farming and moved to Chittagong, Bangladesh\u2019s second-largest city, leaving their two children behind with Mr. Gazi\u2019s mother.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gazi found work immediately as a day laborer, mostly digging foundations. Ms. Aktar searched for a job as a seamstress, but headaches and other slum-induced health problems have so incapacitated her that the couple are desperate to return to Dakope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here for too long,\u201d Mr. Gazi said. \u201cIf we can save some money, then we\u2019ll go back. I\u2019ll work on a piece of land and try to make it fertile again.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the chances of finding fertile land in his home village, where the salty rivers have eaten away acre upon acre, are almost zero.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dozens of people gathered in the narrow mud alley outside Mr. Gazi\u2019s room as he spoke. Some told similar stories of storms, loss and hope, and many nodded as Mr. Gazi spoke of his dreams of returning to his doomed village.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cAll of us came here because of erosions and cyclones,\u201d said Noakhali, a hollow-eyed 30-year-old with a single name who was wearing the traditional skirt of the delta. \u201cNot one of us actually wants to live here.\u201d\n</p></div>", "n_sources": 9}
