What they will not deliver, at least yet, is a steep and rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“Can this administration do a lot on its own? Yes,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. “But,” he added, “if the standard, though, is atmospheric stabilization, I’m skeptical the administration can do anything near enough administratively.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That will require legislation, Mr. Adler said, “especially if a premium is put on getting emissions reductions as soon as possible.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the orders, and two people close to the administration noted that final decisions on them were still being refined.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without legislation, the administration will have to rely on the regulatory process to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and smokestacks and improve vehicle fuel efficiency, but that takes time too. It cannot be done by executive order.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The tons of carbon pollution in the air is what matters in the end,” said Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Profeta said the orders on Wednesday did represent an important first step.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The Biden administration can do quite a bit to start to put the country on the right trajectory with its own authorities,” Mr. Profeta said. Wednesday, he said, “starts the process.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected clampdown on new oil and gas leases goes further than Mr. Biden’s actions on Inauguration Day, which halted the Interior Department and other agencies’ authority to issue drilling leases or permits for 60 days while the administration reviewed the legal and policy implications of the current federal minerals leasing program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new policy will call on agencies to consider how much federal land and waters should be preserved from mining and drilling or set aside for renewable energy production, according to the two people familiar with that order, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the policy publicly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The burning of fossil fuels extracted on public lands and waters accounted for almost a quarter of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions between 2005 and 2014, and Mr. Biden campaigned on ending new drilling as a key to tackling climate change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of the environmental community applauded the plan, though some said Mr. Biden is not going far enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“It’s vital that President Biden permanently ban all new fossil fuel extraction, including fracking, on federal lands and waters,” said Mitch Jones, policy director for Food &amp; Water Watch, an environmental group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate task force that Mr. Biden is expected to create will devise a plan for what administration officials like to call a “whole of government” approach to climate change, and will focus on two main areas: environmental justice and job creation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It will call for every agency to take climate change into consideration in government decisions, from federal procurement to financial regulations to lawsuit settlements, experts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also will create a number of councils and committees to try to ensure that poor and minority communities as well as Americans who live in coal country see the economic benefits of clean energy policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Biden also is expected to revive and strengthen an Obama-era presidential memorandum in 2016 elevating climate change to a national security priority and requiring intelligence agencies to incorporate climate change into their analyses of national security threats. It was quickly revoked by the Trump administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alice Hill, who oversaw climate planning for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that direction from the president is necessary because the senior policymakers who request that analysis, and the intelligence officials who prepare it, often don’t have experience thinking about climate risks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“When I was in the White House, rarely were climate change risks discussed,” Ms. Hill said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She and others said Mr. Biden needed to go further, potentially by converting the memorandum into an executive order that has more authority to direct agencies to take steps like setting strategies and policies to deal with climate-related threats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The climate reality of today is higher temperatures, stronger storms, more destructive wildfires, sea-level rise, acidifying oceans and extended drought,” said Sherri Goodman, a deputy under secretary of defense for environmental security under Obama and now a senior fellow at the Wilson Center’s Environmental Change and Security Program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“We need a climate security plan for America that climate-proofs American infrastructure and puts climate and clean energy innovation front and center,” she said.</p></div>", "choices": ["1", "2"]}
